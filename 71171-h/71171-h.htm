</div>


<p>This Bronze Booklet aims at a survey of the Negro
in American fiction, both as character and author. It
is the first full-length presentation of this subject, but
differs from the usual academic survey by giving a
penetrating analysis of the social factors and attitudes
behind the various schools and periods considered.
Sterling A. Brown, now associate professor of English
at Howard University, born and educated in Washington,
D. C., was graduated from Williams College in
1922 with Phi Beta Kappa honors and the Clark Fellowship
to Harvard, received his master’s degree at
Harvard in 1923, and has since pursued graduate work
in English literature at Harvard University. He has
had wide experience teaching at Virginia Seminary and
College, Lynchburg, Va., 1923-26, at Lincoln University,
Mo., 1926-28, Fisk University, 1928-29, and
at Howard University from 1929 to date. His volume
of verse, <i>Southern Road</i>, published in 1932, put him
in the advance-guard of younger Negro poets, and, as
well, the then new school of American regionalist
literature. In 1937, Professor Brown was awarded a
Guggenheim Fellowship for creative writing and among
other things, will complete for publication his second
volume of verse, “<i>No Hiding Place</i>.” Since 1936, he
has been directing editor on Negro materials of the
<i>Federal Writers’ Project</i> at Washington headquarters.
For the last five years, his literary book review comments
in <i>Opportunity</i> under the caption: “<i>The Literary
Scene</i>,” have revealed a critical talent of sane but progressive
and unacademic tendencies,—a point of view
that the reader will find characteristically carried
through in this provocative and masterly study.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>The treatment of the Negro in American fiction,
since it parallels his treatment in American life, has
naturally been noted for injustice. Like other oppressed
and exploited minorities, the Negro has been interpreted
in a way to justify his exploiters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I swear their nature is beyond my comprehension. A strange
people!—merry ’mid their misery—laughing through their tears,
like the sun shining through the rain. Yet what simple philosophers
they! They tread life’s path as if ’twere strewn with roses
devoid of thorns, and make the most of life with natures of sunshine
and song.</p>
</div>

<p>Most American readers would take this to refer to the
Negro, but it was spoken of the Irish, in a play dealing
with one of the most desperate periods of Ireland’s
tragic history. The Jew has been treated similarly by
his persecutors. The African, and especially the South
African native, is now receiving substantially the same
treatment as the American Negro. Literature dealing
with the peasant and the working-class has, until recently,
conformed to a similar pattern.</p>

<p>The blind men gathered about the elephant. Each
one felt the part of the elephant’s anatomy closest to
him, the trunk, tusk, eyes, ear, hoof, hide and tail.
Then each became an authority on the elephant. The
elephant was all trunk, or all hoof or all hide, or all
tail. So ran their separate truths. The single truth
was that all were blind. This fable, pertinent to our
study, might be continued to tell how some of the blind
men returned to their kingdoms of the blind where it
was advantageous to believe that the elephant was all
trunk or tusk.</p>

<p>We shall see in this study how stereotypes—that the
Negro is <i>all</i> this, that, or the other—have evolved at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the dictates of social policy. When slavery was being
attacked, for instance, southern authors countered with
the contented slave; when cruelties were mentioned,
they dragged forward the comical and happy-hearted
Negro. Admittedly wrong for white people, slavery
was represented as a boon for Negroes, on theological,
biological, psychological warrant. Since Negroes were
of “peculiar endowment,” slavery could not hurt them,
although, inconsistently, it was their punishment, since
they were cursed of God. A corollary was the wretched
freedman, a fish out of water. In Reconstruction, when
threatened with such dire fate as Negroes’ voting,
going to school, and working for themselves (i.e.,
Negro domination), southern authors added the stereotype
of the brute Negro. Even today much social
policy demands that slavery be shown as blessed and
fitting, and the Negro as ludicrously ignorant of his
own best good.</p>

<p>Many authors who are not hostile to the Negro and
some who profess friendship still stress a “peculiar
endowment” at the expense of the Negro’s basic humanity.
Some antislavery authors seemed to believe
that submissiveness was a mystical African quality, and
chose mulattoes for their rebellious heroes, attributing
militancy and intelligence to a white heritage. Many
contemporary authors exploit the Negro’s quaintness,
his “racial qualities.” Whether they do this for an
escape from drab, standardized life or out of genuine
artistic interest or, in the case of Negro authors, out
of race pride, their work suffers from the narrowness
of allegory. It must be added that these authors play
into the hands of reactionaries, who, once a difference
is established, use it to justify peculiar position and
peculiar treatment.</p>

<p>Whether the Negro was human was one of the problems
that racked the brains of the cultured Old South.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
The finally begrudged admission that perhaps he was,
has remained largely nominal in letters as in life.
Complete, complex humanity has been denied to him.
He is too often like characters in the medieval allegories:
now Loyalty, or Mirth, or Servility, or Quaintness,
or Exuberance, or Brutishness, or Lust. Only
seldom is he shown as Labor or Persecution, although
he was brought here to supply the first, and as payment
received the second.</p>

<p>Since there is no stereotype without some basis in
actuality, it goes without saying that individuals could
be found resembling Page’s loyal Uncle Billy or Stark
Young’s William Veal, or Dixon’s brutal Gus, or
Scarlet Sister Mary or Van Vechten’s Lasca, or even
Uncle Tom and Florian Slappey. But when, as is frequent,
generalizations are drawn from these about a
race or a section, the author oversteps his bounds as
novelist, and becomes an amateur social scientist whose
guesses are valueless, and even dangerous. Fiction,
especially on so controversial a subject as the American
Negro, is still subjective, and novelists would do well
to recognize that they are recording a few characters
in a confined social segment, often from a prejudiced
point of view. They cannot, like Bacon, take all for
their province.</p>

<p>Fortunately for American fiction, however, there
have been authors, even from the outset, who heard the
Negro speak as Shakespeare heard Shylock:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He hath disgraced me ... laughed at my losses, mocked at
my gains, scorned my nation ... cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies; and what’s his reason? I am a Jew.... If you prick
us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you
poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
in that.</p>
</div>

<p>We shall see in the nineteenth century many writers,
from Melville to Cable, who have shown sympathy
and comprehension. Nevertheless it is to present-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
realists, a large number of them southerners, that one
must look for the greatest justice to Negro life and
character. They have been less concerned with race
than with environment; they have sought to get at
social causes rather than to prop a social order.</p>

<p>In spite of the publishers’ dicta that certain authors
know <i>the</i> Negro better than Negroes themselves; in
spite of certain authors who believe that slave-holding
ancestry is necessary in order truly to know Negroes
(on the theory that only the owner, or his descendants,
can know the owned); in spite of the science of Negro
mind-reading, flourishing below the Mason-Dixon line,
it is likely that Negro authors will, after the apprentice
years, write most fully and most deeply about their
own people. As we go to the Russians, the Scandinavians,
and the French for the truth about their
people; as we go to the workers and not to the stockholders,
to the tenants and croppers and not to the
landlords, for the truth about the lives of tenants and
croppers, so it seems that we should expect the truth of
Negro life from Negroes. The Negro artist has a fine
task ahead of him to render this truth in enduring fiction.
So far, much of what seems truthful has been
the work of sympathetic white authors. In all probability
white authors will continue to write about the
Negro. Sometimes similarly conditioned in America’s
class structure, sometimes extremely sensitive and
understanding, they will get at valuable truth. But
Negro novelists must accept the responsibility of being
the ultimate portrayers of their own.</p>

<p class="c sp">EARLY APPEARANCES</p>


<p><i>Early Fiction.</i> When Americans started to write
novels, at the end of the eighteenth century, the Negro
was definitely part and parcel of American life.
Colonial authors from Cotton Mather and Samuel
Sewall to Benjamin Franklin, Crèvecour and John
Woolman had protested his enslavement. He was the
rock upon which the constitution nearly split. In the
North, there were still a few slaves and a growing body
of freedmen, some of whom, like Phillis Wheatley,
Benjamin Banneker, Richard Allen, and Crispus Attucks,
were more than locally known. The vast hordes
of slaves, together with a good number of free
Negroes, were a more integral part of southern society.
They had cleared the forests and laid the roads, had
built the fine houses and wrought the beautiful iron-work;
had labored on the tobacco, rice, indigo and
cotton plantations so that their masters could buy more
slaves. Cotton was not yet king, the cotton-gin was
not invented; but the broad backs of the slaves were
still supporting a heavy load. Whether as house-servant
grateful for easy favors, and contributing to
the master’s feeling of safety, or field-hand, or fugitive
stealing away to the North, or intractable revolter,
throwing both northern and southern communities into
consternation, the Negro was recognizably part of the
American scene.</p>

<p>But the first groping American novels were still tied
to Mother England’s leading strings. For all of their
patriotism, the novelists were little concerned with
American actualities. When the Negro character was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
included, he was a shadowy figure in the background,
an element of romantic side interest, closer to Aphra
Behn’s <i>Oroonoko</i> and Defoe’s fiction than to what the
novelists could have seen about them.</p>

<p>The earliest novels, William Hill Brown’s <i>The
Power of Sympathy</i> (1789) and Mrs. Susannah Rowson’s
<i>The Inquisitor</i> (1794), true to their sentimental
models, have antislavery feeling. Hugh Brackenridge’s
<i>Modern Chivalry</i> (1792 to 1815) contains a
good ironic attack upon the slave-trade, and a less
successful character Cuff, whose jargon seems plucked
out of Defoe:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, shentiman, I say, dat de first man was da black a-man,
an’ de first woman was de black a-woman: get two-tree children;
de rain vasha dese, an’ de snow pleach, an’ de coula came brown,
yella, coppa coula, and at de last quite fite....</p>
</div>

<p>Royal Tyler’s <i>The Algerine Captive</i> (1797) deplores
the “middle passage” horrors of the slave-trade in the
sentimental mode: “I thought of my native land and
blushed.” Charles Brockden Brown’s novels contain
Negro characters only incidentally. There were no
English models to make these early novelists aware
that servitude and struggle could be subjects for fiction.</p>

<p><i>Irving.</i> In the nineteenth century, interest in the
Negro increased. In <i>Salmagundi</i> (1807) Washington
Irving, a brisk young man-about-town, records the
Negro curiosities he finds, such as the “Negro wench,
principal musician at a ball.” He describes a dance
in Haiti with unctuous ridicule:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the middle of the rout, when all was buzz, slip-slop, clack
and perfume, who should enter but Tucky Squash! The yellow
beauties blushed blue and the black ones blushed as red as they
could ... for he was the pride of the court, the pick of all the
sable fair ones of Hayti. Such breadth of nose, such exuberance
of lip! his shins had the true cucumber curve; his face in dancing
shone like a kettle.... When he laughed, there appeared from
ear to ear a <i>chevaux de-frize</i> of teeth that rivaled the shark’s in
whiteness.... No Long Island Negro could shuffle you “double-trouble”
or “hoe corn and dig potatoes” more scientifically.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>
<p>Here we have the first comic Negro in American
fiction, assured of long employment from Irving to
Octavus Roy Cohen. <i>Salmagundi</i> likewise includes
Caesar, a “weatherbeaten wiseacre of a Negro,” who
henpecks his masters, tell stories of ghosts, goblins and
witches, and, like a good man Friday, accompanies his
master to his sparking and dancing. Caesar is repeated
in <i>The Knickerbocker History of New York</i> (1809)
as an old crone who would croak:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a string of incredible stories about New England witches—grisly
ghost horses without heads,—and hairbreadth escapes, and bloody
encounters among the Indians.</p>
</div>

<p>“Adventures of the Black Fisherman” in <i>Tales of A
Traveler</i> (1824) tells us only that Black Sam or Mud
Sam was “supposed to know all the fish in the river
by their christian names,” and that he had a “great
relish for the horrible,” such as executions, and that all
of the urchins felt free to play tricks upon him. Irving
does not attempt to give his speech, much less his
character.</p>

<p><i>Cooper.</i> The first American novelist to aim at fullness
in his presentation of American life, James Fenimore
Cooper naturally included the Negro. Although
limited in information and skill, he expanded and
improved upon the slight sketches of his forerunners.
He presents Negroes of many types. First of all,
there is Caesar Thompson, the loyal retainer in <i>The
Spy</i> (1821). True to the prevailing literary attitude
of the gentry towards underlings, Cooper burlesques
his appearance with what passed for humor in those
days:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But it was in his legs that nature had indulged her most capricious
humor. There was an abundance of material injudiciously
used. The calves were neither before nor behind, but rather on
the outer side of the limb, inclining forward.... The leg was
placed so near the center as to make it sometimes a matter of
dispute whether he was not walking backward.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless Caesar is shown as crafty, and courageous
in the service of his family. Cooper’s interest in
Negroes is continued in <i>The Pioneers</i> (1823) in
Agamemnon, not a slave but a legal ward, a man-of-all
work whose deference does not keep him from mirth
at his master’s expense, and Abraham, a free black who
shares in the rough frontier life.</p>

<p>A different type is the free Sailor, Scipio Africa, one
of the heroes of <i>The Red Rover</i> (1827). In physique,
seamanship, self-control, and intelligence he is superior
to his sailing mates, but this does not shield him from
their petty insults. There is pathos in the scene of
his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If he is not (a Christian) I don’t know who the devil is. A
man who serves his country, is true to his messmate, and has no
sulk about him, I call a saint, so far as mere religion goes. I say,
Guinea, my hearty, give the chaplain a grip of the fist.... A
Spanish windlass would not give a stronger screw than the knuckle
of that nigger an hour ago; and now, you see to what a giant may
be brought!</p>
</div>

<p>In <i>The Last of The Mohicans</i> (1826), Cora Munro,
the offspring of a mixed marriage, is shown to be
resourceful and strong, above the usual run of Cooper’s
“females.” It is worthy of note, since she is the first
of a long line of “octoroons,” that her end is tragic.</p>

<p>Cooper thus anticipates later creators of Negro
characters, presenting the faithful house servant, the
courageous man of action, and the octoroon doomed to
tragedy. Though crudely recorded, his dialect rises
above the usually impossible Negro speech in early
novels. No abolitionist, Cooper still did not favor
slavery, and honest observer that he was, he refuses
to see the Negro, even when grotesquely described, as
subhuman.</p>

<p><i>Simms.</i> William Gilmore Simms, of South Carolina,
differed from Cooper, his northern model, in that he
defended slavery ardently. In his fiction, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Negroes are presented without excessive argument.
They range from the obsequious house-servant to the
brave freeman. Hector, in <i>The Yemassee</i> (1832) is a
heroic slave, participating gallantly in the Indian warfare,
volunteering for perilous service, warning blockhouses,
and rescuing his master. He is extremely loyal
and refuses to be freed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I d—n to h—-, maussa, if I gwine to be free.... ’Tis onpossible,
maussa.... Enty I know wha’ kind of ting freedom is
wid black man? Ha! you make Hector free, he turn wuss more
nor poor buckrah—he tief out of de shop—he git drunk and lie
in de ditch....</p>
</div>

<p>This passage is the first and most influential example
of a scene soon to be hackneyed. Caesar in <i>Guy
Rivers</i> (1834) is subservient, but cunning and philosophical.
<i>The Partisan</i> (1835) gains in interest
because of the presence of Tom, who is such a good
cook that Porgy, his gourmet master, will not brook
his being abused. Tom repays by keeping his master
fat and happy “so long as dere’s coon and possum,
squirrel, patridges and dub, duck in de ribber, and fish
in de pond.”</p>

<p>Simms’ <i>Richard Hurdis</i> (1838) shows slaves accompanying
their masters on the move to the Alabama
frontier, dancing, singing, sometimes listening to a
fellow slave’s impromptu verses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In them he satirized his companions without mercy ... and did
not spare his own master, whom he compared to a squirrel that
had lived upon good corn so long that he now hungered for bad
in his desire for change.</p>
</div>

<p>In <i>The Forayers</i> (1855) Cato is a slave-driver, courageous
and devoted to his family, and Benny Bowlegs,
another driver, is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a moral steam engine. He pushed his master as well as his
brother slaves.... Push at the beginning, push in the middle,
push at the end, and Ben’s pushing made crops.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Wigwam and The Cabin</i> (1845) a collection of
stories, is unusual in showing Negroes at the center<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of the picture. “The Loves of The Driver” casts side-lights
upon plantation customs, and the “Lazy Crow”
is the first to portray Negro superstition and folkways.</p>

<p>In numbers, and a certain rudimentary realism, the
Negro characters in Simms’ many novels go beyond
those of any other early nineteenth century novelist.
Simms bungles when he tries to record the Gullah
dialect, but the effort is worthy of comment. Striving
to be accepted as a southern gentleman, Simms shows
his slaves, generally, to be well cared for and contented.
Nevertheless, his urge to realism kept him
from showing slavery to be an endless picnic. Masters
held forth freedom as a reward for service; they
knew, if the contented slaves did not. All in all, however,
Simms is noteworthy more for the extensiveness
of his gallery of Negroes than for any depth of characterization.</p>

<p>As Simms showed Negroes participating in the backwoods
life and warfare of the South, so earlier writers
of the westward movement included sketches of
Negroes. Paulding’s <i>Westward Ho</i> (1832) deals
with southerners leaving what romancers were to consider
Arcadia for a better land. In this novel, Pompey,
like Simms’ Hector, refuses freedom. <i>Nick of
The Woods</i> (1837) a melodrama of bloody Kentucky
by Robert Bird, includes several Negroes. Emperor
is most fully characterized: like Cooper’s Caesar he is
loyal, worshipful of quality, and, grotesque. Although
his “natural” cowardice is insisted upon, his actions
belie this, as he fights for his “little missie” and dies
the death of a hero, “gored by numberless wounds,
and trampled by the feet of his slayers.”</p>

<p><i>The Virginians.</i> Virginia is the setting for such
novelists as W. A. Carruthers, Beverley and George
Tucker, and John Esten Cooke. Their novels describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the gentry and their complaisant slaves who enter the
books as unobtrusively as they entered the grand dining
rooms to bring in sweet missives or decanters of old
port. These mammies and butlers and coachmen are
interchangeable, appearing in different books under
different classical names, but always the same.</p>

<p>Toby in Poe’s “The Journal of Julius Rodman”
(1840) is “as ugly an old gentleman as ever spoke,
having ... swollen lips, large white protruding eyes,
flat nose, long ears, double head, pot-belly, and bow-legs.”
He is another of Poe’s sad attempts at humor.
Jupiter, in “The Gold-Bug” (1843), traditionally
refuses to leave his master, but threatens in all seriousness
to beat him, a hot-blooded cavalier, with a big
stick. His dialect, an attempt at Gullah, is language
belonging with Poe’s masterpieces, “out of space and
out of time.” Poe revealed that his southern upbringing
had borne fruit, however, when, defending slavery
from “the fanaticism of the Northern Abolitionists”
he writes that it is the will of God that the Negro
should have a “peculiar nature,” of which one characteristic
is his tremendous loyalty to his master, “to
which the white man’s heart is a stranger.” The
master has a “reciprocal feeling of parental attachment
to his humble dependent”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>he who is taught to call the little negro his in this sense and
<i>because he loves him</i>, shall love him <i>because he is his</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Melville.</i> A greater writer than Poe in his grasp of
character, Herman Melville was above this sophistry
in dealing with human beings. A northerner, Melville
did not know slavery at first hand; but a mariner, he
did know Negro seamen. <i>Moby Dick</i> (1851) reveals
this knowledge.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Daggoo] a gigantic coal-black negro ... retained all his
barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in
all the pomp of six feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal
humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing before
him seemed a white flag come to beg truce from a fortress.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>If Daggoo is the “noble savage,” Pip, as sympathetically
created, is of another breed. Pip’s cowardice is
not considered racial but is naturally human.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod’s forecastle ye shall
see him, beating his tambourine, prelusive of the eternal time,
when sent for to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike
in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory: called a coward
here, hailed a hero there!</p>
</div>

<p>Negro sailors, generally courageous and praiseworthy,
occur in Melville’s other romances of the sea.</p>

<p><i>Benito Cereno</i> (1855) is a masterpiece of mystery,
suspense and terror. Captain Delano of the <i>Bachelor’s
Delight</i>, discovering a vessel in distress along the uninhabited
coast of Chile, boards her to render aid. He
is interested in the many Negroes he finds on the decks:
“like most men of a good blithe heart he took to Negroes
not philanthropically, but genially, just as other
men to Newfoundland dogs.” He is mystified, however,
when the gamesome Negroes flare up in momentary
rage, and especially by their continual clashing
their hatchets together. Only when Don Benito, in
desperation, escapes to Delano’s ship, does the real
truth dawn.</p>

<p>There had been a revolt on board the <i>San Dominick</i>;
the Negro sailors and the slaves had killed many
of the whites, and had kept the others alive only for
their skill as navigators in order to reach a Negro
country. The mutineers and revolters are overcome in
a bloody battle, carried to Lima, and executed. The
contrast between the reputed gentleness of Negroes
“that makes them the best body-servants in the world,”
and the fierceness with which they fight for freedom
is forcibly driven home. Certain Negroes stand out:
Babo who, resembling a “begging friar,” engineered
the revolt with great skill and is almost fiendish in
his manner of breaking down Cereno’s morale; Francesco,
the mulatto barber; Don José, personal servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of a Spanish Don; and Atulfa, an untamed African
chieftain, all filled with hatred for whites. Melville
graphically pictures the slave mothers, “equally ready
to die for their infants or fight for them”; the four
old men monotonously polishing their hatchets; and
the murderous Ashantees. All bear witness to what
Melville recognized as a spirit that it would take years
of slavery to break.</p>

<p>Although opposed to slavery, Melville does not
make <i>Benito Cereno</i> into an abolitionist tract; he is
more concerned with a thrilling narrative and character
portrayal. But although the mutineers are blood-thirsty
and cruel, Melville does not make them into
villains; they revolt as mankind has always revolted.
Because Melville was unwilling to look upon men as
“Isolatoes,” wishing instead of discover the “common
continent of man,” he comes nearer the truth in his
scattered pictures of a few unusual Negroes than do
the other authors of this period.</p>

<p><i>Frontier Humor.</i> The southern humorists, thriving
from the thirties to the sixties, introduce the Negro
only incidentally in their picture of horse-swapping,
gander-pulling, camp meetings, fights, and political
brawls. Because they were realistic, the “plantations”
they show are most often backwood farms. The hard-fisted
frontier squires, with a love of horse-play, and
a callousness necessary for survival, treat their slaves
as one would expect: they are neither Legrees nor
American versions of Sir Roger de Coverly. In <i>Georgia
Scenes</i> (1835), Longstreet non-committally shows
a Southern backwoods “lady” knocking her servant
around from mere habit. In <i>Adventures of Simon Suggs</i>
(1846) Johnson Hooper gives good pictures of southern
camp-meetings, at which Negroes and whites vie
in religious hysteria, mingling indiscriminately in the
hollow square, plunging and pitching about in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
“jerks” and screaming “glory” in unsegregated chorus.</p>

<p>George Harris in <i>Sut Lovingood Yarns</i> (1867) tells
of a rowdy whose antics include poking a hornet’s
nest into a Negro camp meeting. At another time, Sut
removes a corpse and lays a snoring, drunken Negro
in the coffin. When the slave preacher Simon comes to
the coffin he yells:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Oh Goramighty massy on dis soul; de debil hesef on top of
brudder Seize!...” Jis then I moaned out in a orful doleful vise,
“Hiperkrit, cum tu hell, I has a claim ontu you fu holdin the bag
while Seize stole co’n.” He jes rar’d backwards, an’ fell outen
the door wif his hans locked, an’ sed he in a weak ... sort of
vise, “Please marster” an’ jis fainted, he soon cum to a-runnin’,
fer I hearn the co’n crashin thru the big field like a in-gine were
runnin’ express thru hit. I hain’t seen Simon ter this day.</p>
</div>

<p>Other humorists tell of frontier surgery upon slaves;
if they were not ill before, they were near death’s
door after the barbarous operations.</p>

<p>The tone of the humorists is burlesque, which often
sinks to the level of present-day “darky” jokes. Nevertheless,
southern humor is significant. The assumption
that Negroes are especially designed as butts for
rough practical jokes is probably closer to the reality
of the antebellum South than the sentimentality of
more ambitious works.</p>

<p>True to the manner of cracker-box philosophers,
Artemus Ward attacks the sentimentalized and the
unconventional, and delivers many of the “common-man’s”
jibes at abolitionists and Negroes. “The
Octoroon” is, at least, a refreshing departure from
the shopworn tragic mode.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hush—shese a Octoroon!”</p>

<p>“No! sez I ... yu don’t say so! How long she bin that way?”</p>

<p>“From her arliest infuncy,” sed he.</p>

<p>“Wall, what upon arth duz she do it fur?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“She kan’t help it.... It’s the brand of Kane.”</p>
</div>

<p>Oberlin College is lampooned for being rather “too
strong on Ethiopians.” Though a good Unionist in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the war, Artemus Ward, unlike his successor Nasby,
does not reveal any sympathy for the Negro.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> Irving’s tellers of mysterious legends,
Cooper’s house-servants, Melville’s mates in the
foc’sle, and the obsequious servants of the Virginia
cavaliers reflect their authors’ interests and experience
more than they interpret Negro life. Simms’ blood
and thunder melodramas and the farces of the frontier
humorists give more varied types and experiences, with
some crude realism. Melville’s <i>Benito Cereno</i> goes
more deeply into character. In the main, however,
these subsidiary characters are not very convincing.
They speak a pidgin English, closer to the speech of
Robinson Crusoe’s Friday than to that of nineteenth
century Negroes. Cooper and Simms tried to record
dialects; Simms is probably better since Gullah is
nearer to pidgin English, but he is still inaccurate.
Some authors presented the Negro with dignity and
sympathy, but serious realism was still far off. It is
worthy of note, however, that such favorite Negro
characters as the fabler, the loyal servant, the buffoon,
the tragic octoroon, the noble savage, and the revolter,
appear in these early books.</p>

<p>Although in a few cases propaganda for or against
slavery raises its head, these subsidiary characters are
not made into walking arguments. Toward the end of
this period, however, the slavery debate broke out,
and, in the words of one critic, “the world of nature
was lost in the world of controversy.”</p>


<p class="c p2">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</p>

<p>1. Why were early American novels “tied to Mother
England’s leading strings?”</p>

<p>2. What tradition of English literature might account
for Irving’s and Cooper’s humorous treatment
of the Negro?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>3. Since Simms was proslavery, what is inconsistent
about his showing Negroes being set free as reward
for heroic services?</p>

<p>4. What historical incidents could have suggested
Melville’s <i>Benito Cereno</i>?</p>

<p>5. What in Poe’s life might have occasioned his
attitude toward the Negro?</p>

<p>6. In which of the works mentioned is the Negro
character a foreground character?</p>

</div>

<p class="c">THE PLANTATION TRADITION: PRO-SLAVERY FICTION</p>


<p><i>The Plantation Tradition.</i> The growth and accuracy
of the plantation tradition have been excellently
studied in <i>The Southern Plantation</i> (1925) by Francis
Pendleton Gaines. Gaines attributes the tradition’s
hold on America to a love of feudalism,(in spite of
our profession of democracy), the charm of the Negro
characters as “native” literary material, and a
romantic wish for an Arcadian past. He proves that
“the tradition omits much plantation truth and exaggerates
freely certain attractive features of the old
life.” But the tradition goes on unabashed; over a
century old, it still guarantees best selling fame.</p>

<p>The setting is familiar:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The old plantation; a great mansion; exquisitely gowned
ladies and courtly gentlemen moving with easy grace upon the
broad veranda behind stalwart columns; surrounding the yard
an almost illimitable stretch of white cotton; darkies singingly
at work in the fields, Negro quarters, off on one side, around
which little pickaninnies tumbled in gay frolic.</p>
</div>

<p>It is used in advertisements for coffee, pancake flour,
phonograph records, and whiskey. It is a favorite
American dream. The characters are as constant as
the cotton bolls: the courtly planter, the one hundred
per-cent southern belle, the duelling cavalier, the
mammy or cook, “broadbosomed ... with vari-colored
turban, spotless apron, and beaming face,” the plantation
uncle, black counterpart “of the master so
loyally served and imitated,” and the banjo-plunking
minstrel of the quarters.</p>

<p>Since the plantation tradition tells of a glory that
must have no blemish, slavery is explained away as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
benevolent guardianship, necessary for a childish
people’s transition from heathendom to Christianity.
By stressing festivities such as harvesting, corn-shucking,
hunting, fishing, balls, weddings and holiday seasons,
slavery was presented as “an unbroken Mardi
Gras.” Since southerners, merely because they are born
in the South, are a kindlier, gentler breed than other
mortals, the possible abuses of slavery existed only in
the minds of fanatical Yankees.</p>

<p>Plantation tradition fiction, reenforcing proslavery
thought, was in turn reenforced by it. Occasionally
southern economists admitted that slavery was the
basis of southern commerce and civilization. But these
dismal scientists were too outspoken for the sentimental
romancers. Southern physiologists who proved
that “by an unknown law of nature none but the black
race can bear exposure to the tropical sun,” justified
the sippers of juleps on shaded verandahs. Theologians
defended slavery as having Biblical support since
Ham was cursed by God. In the main, however, the
plantation tradition advanced less unfeeling arguments:
the grown-up slaves were contented, the pickaninnies
were frolicking, the steamboat was hooting
around the bend, God was in his heaven, and all was
right with the world.</p>

<p><i>The Tradition Begins.</i> <i>Swallow Barn</i>, the first
example of the plantation tradition, appeared in 1832.
J. P. Kennedy, the author, was skillful, but his picture
relies upon Addison, Goldsmith, Walter Scott,
and proslavery thought more than upon observation
and understanding. His mouthpiece in these sketches
is Littleton, a northerner (Kennedy himself was a
Marylander, southern in upbringing), who comes
South with an “inky intent” to see the worst of slavery,
but remains to worship it. The southern aristocrats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
are not in love with the institution of slavery, but realize
that it is necessary for the Negro who is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>essentially parasitical, dependent upon guidance for his most
indispensable necessaries, without foresight or thrift of any kind....
I am quite sure they never could become a happier people
than I find them here.... No tribe of people have ever passed
from barbarism to civilization whose progress has been more
secure from harm, more genial to their character, or better supplied
with mild and beneficent guardianship adapted to the
actual state of their intellectual feebleness, than the negroes of
Swallow Barn.</p>
</div>

<p>In accordance with this ideal coloring, Negro children
are shown “basking on the sunny sides of cabins [like]
terrapins luxuriating on the logs of a mill-pond.”
Slaves seem to be kept busiest tending their own garden
patches, of which they sell the produce. “I never meet
a Negro man—unless he is quite old—that he is not
whistling; and the women sing from morning to
night.” Negroes are shown as ludicrous:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And when to these are added a few, reverend, wrinkled
decrepit old men, with faces shortened as if with drawing
strings, noses that seemed to have run all to nostril, and with
feet of the configuration of a mattock, my readers will have a
tolerably correct idea of the negro-quarter.</p>
</div>

<p>Hardships come chiefly from meddling abolitionists:
“We alone are able to deal properly with the
subject.” Kennedy shows how he can add sweetening
to the bitter by explaining the breaking up of families
(Tidewater fortunes were frequently based upon
domestic slave-trading) as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All before Abe had been successively <i>dismissed</i> from Lucy’s
cabin, as they reached the age fit to render them serviceable, with
that satisfied concern that belongs to a negro mother who trusts
to the kindness of her master. [Italics mine.]</p>
</div>

<p>Kennedy admits that the recording of dialect was
beyond him. A great deal more was beyond him, but
that does not keep <i>Swallow Barn</i> from being influential
upon literature about Negro life and character.</p>

<p>In his plays, especially <i>The Gladiator</i> (1831),
Robert Montgomery Bird took an antislavery stand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
but his satirical novel <i>Sheppard Lee</i> (1836) was proslavery.
Part of the book deals with a Quaker philanthropist,
confused and futile, who goes to the South to
work for abolition. The slaves on the plantation are
shown living happily under an indulgent master until
an antislavery tract changes them into burners, ravagers
and murderers.</p>

<p><i>Proslavery Humorists.</i> Although, for the sake of
the record, Sam Slick, the comic character of T. H.
Haliburton’s <i>Yankee Stories</i> (1836) announces that
he dislikes slavery, most of his comments justify it. He
objects to enslaving white men for debt, but “those
thick-skulled, crooked-shanked, flat-footed, long
heeled, woolly headed gentlemen don’t seem fit for
much else but slavery ... they ain’t fit to contrive for
themselves.” He ridicules the talk of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>broken hearted slaves killin’ themselves in despair—task-master’s
whip acuttin’ into their flesh—burnin’ suns,—day o’ toil—nights
o’ grief—pestilential rice grounds—chains—starvation—misery
and death,—grand figurs them for oratory.</p>
</div>

<p>He is unwilling that abolitionists should be lynched,
but they should learn how the cowskin feels. To prove
slavery no hardship, he reasons that a married woman
is a slave, and if she happens to get the upper hand,
the husband is a slave, and leads a worse life than any
Negro. Sam’s brother, a lawyer in Charleston, S. C.,
forces an old white swindler to buy a Negro back into
slavery, for the good of the Negro. These stories do
not belong to the plantation tradition, for some mention
“nigger-jockies,” i.e., “gentlemen who trade in
nigger flesh,” and a planter who has “one white wife
and fourteen black concubines.” But they are proslavery
in sympathy. Sam Slick is significant in that
he represents a large number of northerners who were
never too fond of Negroes and strongly opposed abolition.
Some of these became catchers of runaway slaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and many expressed their hatred of the Civil War in
the Draft Riots.</p>

<p>When William H. Thompson, Georgia humorist,
sent Major Jones on his travels in the forties, he was
able to get in many proslavery thrusts. Mary Jones
wants to take along her slave Prissy, since she is unwilling
to have white servants:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I could never bear to see a white gall toatin’ my child about,
waiting on me like a nigger. It would hurt my conscience to keep
anybody ’bout me in that condition, who was as white and as
good as me.... A servant, to be any account as a servant, is
got to have a different kind of spirit from other people; and
anybody that would make a nigger of a white child, because it
was pore, hain’t got no Christian principle in ’em.</p>
</div>

<p>Uncle Ned believes that abolitionists have horns like
billy-goats, eyes like balls of fire, and great forked tails
like sea serpents. “Ugh, chile, dey wusser’n collery-morbus.”
When these fierce creatures get hold of
Negroes, ruin is come; here is Major Jones describing
the free Negroes of the North:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pore, miserable, sickly-lookin’ creaters! it was enuff to make
a abolitionist’s hart ake to see ’em crawlin’ out of the damp
straw of the cellars, to sun themselves on the cellar-dores till
they got able to start out to by or to steal sumthing to eat ... many
of ’em was diseased and bloated up like frogs, and lay
sprawlin’ about like so many cooters in a mud-hole ... like
lizards in a pile of rotten logs.... This, thinks I, is nigger freedom:
this is the condition to which the philanthropists of the
North wants to bring the happy black people of the South!</p>
</div>

<p><i>First Answers to Mrs. Stowe.</i> In the three years
following the appearance of <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>
(1852), there were at least fourteen proslavery novels
published, besides numerous pamphlets, articles, and
a long poem. W. L. G. Smith’s <i>Life At The South</i>, or
<i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin As It Is</i> (1852) was struck off
while the iron was hot, borrowing illustrations from
<i>Swallow Barn</i> and passages from <i>The Yemassee</i>. Uncle
Tom, irked at being outdone in the fields by the
younger, stronger Hector, and jealous of his master’s
favoritism, moodily listens to an abolitionist, and runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
away. In Canada he finds real slavery; in Buffalo he
sees the freedmen in wretchedness, discovering one
frozen to death in a snow storm. Finally he begs his
master to return him to the South, which that gentleman
does out of Christian consideration and forgivingness.
The following passage shows Dinah refusing
to join Tom in seeking freedom:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dinah: “... An’ den wha’ would be de feelin’s of your own
Dinah. She would curse de hour when she was born. No, no! I
cannot consent to be a party to sich an arrangement.”</p>

<p>Tom: “How silly you talk. You will do noffin yourself, an’ you
will let no one help. I begin to think, you hab revoked your
decision.... Dere you hab it; you now know’d my feelin’s.”</p>

<p>Dinah did not know what to say in reply ... “there is something
in this idea of being free that I cannot comprehend,” she thought
to herself.</p>
</div>

<p>This passed for Negro speech and psychology in proslavery
novels. Hector likewise refuses to be free in
a speech stolen from the Hector of Simms’ <i>Yemassee</i>.
Allgood, a hypocritical philanthropist, and Bates, an
abolitionist busybody, are types that later novels were
to repeat.</p>

<p>In the same year, Caroline E. Rush sent forth her
little book, <i>North and South</i>, or <i>Slavery and Its Contrasts</i>,
to teach the Northern reader “boundless, illimitable
love,” that would make him “regret the necessary
evils of the Slavery of the South, without bitter
feelings towards those who are born amid the peculiar
rights and duties of the slaveholders.” The thousands
of free Negroes in Philadelphia pain Mrs. Rush
because of their lack of an “elegant degree of refinement
and cultivation”; their poverty is racial debauchery,
while the poverty of the whites is victimization.
What are the abuses suffered by slaves</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>to the real, bitter, oppression that in our own midst sweeps its
thousands out of a life of penury into premature graves?</p>
</div>

<p>Tears should not be shed for Uncle Tom—“a hardy,
strong and powerful Negro”—but should be reserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
for helpless, defenseless, children—“of the same color
as yourself.” Writing of plantation Negroes she
wishes that she too had “taken lessons of a colored
professor, and was conversant enough with Negro dialect,
to launch out boldly into their sea of beauties,”
but she is forced to leave the speech to her readers’
imagination. Little is left to their imagination, however,
when she describes the cabins of the field-hands,
embowered in Cherokee roses. At this point, the
book’s illustration resembles a suburban paradise
adjoining the White House. When the slave-mistress
gently patted a quadroon’s head, she “intimated a
freedom which is not often shown to the servants in
the North.” Mrs. Rush is correct here; there was a
great deal of such freedom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastman’s <i>Aunt Phyllis’ Cabin</i> likewise appeared
in 1852. This popular novel glorified slavery
and denounced abolitionists, particularly Mrs. Stowe,
but it did attempt to describe slave life. Bacchus prays
hard and drinks harder; many of his antics—his love
for cast-off finery, the banjo, and big words—could
grace a minstrel show. Aunt Phyllis is one of the first
to appear of the mighty race of “mammies.” The title
character of John W. Page’s <i>Uncle Robin in His Cabin</i>
(1853) puts the author’s beliefs into dialect: he does
not want freedom for himself, and the Negro who is
dissatisfied should go back where he came from:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dis, sir, is no country for free black men: Africa de only place
[for] he, sir....”</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sentimentality of The Old South.</i> Mrs. Caroline
Lee Hentz, a northerner married to a southern gentleman,
turned out a number of blood-and-tears romances.
In <i>Marcus Warland</i> (1852) and in <i>Linda</i> (1857) she
celebrates the mammy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aunt Judy’s African blood had not been corrupted by the base
mingling of a paler strain. Black as ebony was her smooth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
shining skin, on which the dazzling ivory of her teeth threw gleams
bright as the moon at midnight. Judy had loved—adored, reverenced
her, as being of a superior, holier race than her own.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Planter’s Northern Bride</i> (1854) by Mrs. Hentz
shows the typically converted northern girl. After her
appearance on the plantation has elicited rapturous
cries of adoration from the slaves, she is won over
to the peculiar institution. “Oh! my husband! I never
dreamed that slavery could present an aspect so tender
and affectionate!” The husband, though a perfect
master, modestly says that he is “not as good as the
majority of masters.” His slaves are fat, sleek and
good natured; on Sunday, at church, they are “fashionably
attired” and there is “the rustle of tissues, the
fluttering of muslin and laces, the waving of feathery
fans, the glitter of jewelry.” The planter proves that
the Negro was divinely ordained for slavery since</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>his skull has a hardness and thickness greater than our own,
which defy the arrowy sunbeams ... and his skin secretes a far
greater quantity of moisture and throws back the heat absorbed
by us.</p>
</div>

<p>Crissy, misled by an abolitionist, crosses the Ohio and
finds freedom too much for her—“the only slavery she
had ever known.” An incipient revolt is nipped by
Moreland, who, appalled by “the intolerable burden of
the slaves’ treachery and ingratitude” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I would rather, ten thousand times, cultivate these broad fields
myself, than be served by faithless hand and false, hollow hearts.
I have hands that can work. I would do it cheerfully; if labor
was the portion God had assigned to me in the world. Better, far
better, the toiling limbs than the aching heart! He paused a
moment in indescribable emotion.</p>
</div>

<p>The slaves, naturally, break down and weep. All are
forgiven, except Vulcan, who had lifted his “rebel
arm” against Moreland: “You must never more wield
the hammer or strike the anvil for me.... Go—you
are free!” Poor Vulcan....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. M. J. McIntosh in <i>The Lofty and The Lowly,
or Good in All and None All-good</i> (1854), hopes for
the solution of the most difficult problem: “how the
slave may be elevated to the condition of an intelligent,
accountable being, without detriment to the master’s
interest.” Mrs. McIntosh is sure that the solution
cannot come from the fanatical North; she hopes that
the South “with its greater sympathy, love and understanding
will awaken to its responsibilities.” Daddy
Cato, who has grown gray in faithful service at Montrose
Hall, Savannah, is set free and given a little
homeplace. He is not proud of his freedom; he will be
proud only when he can read the Bible and is free of
sin. Following his beloved family to the North, he is
highly insulted when he is approached by Boston
abolitionists.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Make me free! how can I free any more? Dem da nonsense
people, and what dem want take me from Miss Alice for?...
I wonder if I been sick and couldn’t do any ting, ef dem would
nuss me and take care o’ me liken Miss Alice.... I tink dem
crazy ’bout free. Free bery good ting, but free ent all; when you
sick, free won’t make you well, free won’t gib you clo’s, no
hom’ny, let ’lone meat.</p>
</div>

<p>Needless to say, the other slaves at Montrose, away
from these crazy people talking about “free,” live
their childish lives in happiness. <i>The Lofty and The
Lowly</i> is full of piety toward southern divinity.</p>

<p><i>The Defense Sums Up Its Case.</i> Mrs. Henry R.
Schoolcraft’s <i>The Black Gauntlet</i> (1860) is likewise
a compendium of proslavery arguments. The comfortable,
well-ventilated slave homes “with sitting and
sleeping room” and a loft for storing provisions are
compared with the dens, holes, cellars and tenements
of poor whites in northern cities. Food is good and
abundant, with game and fish caught in the slave’s
plentiful off time. Slaves were given an acre of
ground for their own use and allowed to raise hogs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and poultry, of which the produce was sold at full
market price. That slaves were ever knocked senseless
is “purest fiction,” since “their skulls are so thick that
it is doubtful whether any white man’s strength could
consummate such a feat.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am so satisfied that slavery is the school God has established
for the conversion of barbarous nations, that were I an absolute
Queen of these United States, my first missionary enterprise would
be to send to Africa, to bring the heathen as slaves to this Christian
land, and keep them in bondage until compulsory labor had
tamed their beastliness....</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Schoolcraft was a bit late, however; for over two
centuries countless ships had been sent, and millions
of Africans had been brought “to school” in Christian
lands.</p>

<p>Since “not a living man can swear that he has ever
heard antislavery sentiment from a slave in the South,”
the suffering of the Negro, to Mrs. Schoolcraft, is a
lie whipped up by northern politicians. Runaway slaves
are always the good-for-nothing rowdies, who flee to
escape work and discipline. The separation of slave
husbands and wives is no tragedy, since all are polygamists
as in Africa.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not believed by the author that such a monstrosity (babies
sold from mothers) has ever occurred in South Carolina, as a
mistress there usually takes more care of her little Negro property
than a black mother ever does of her children.</p>
</div>

<p>Poetic justice is in the book: the poor dupe of abolitionists
is betrayed into crimes that “destroyed and
grieved her conscience,” but the faithful mammy is
well rewarded. <i>The Black Gauntlet</i> is an extreme case
of special pleading, where vilification of the accursed
Negro alternates with praise of his blessedness in
slavery. It is noteworthy, however, that Mrs. Schoolcraft’s
use of Negro dialect, in this case the Gullah
of the low country, is as good as that of any preceding
writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Suggested by “a popular work of fiction, abusive of
southern slavery,” <i>The Yankee Slave Dealer</i> by a
Texan (1860) has for its subtitle <i>An Abolitionist
Down South</i>. The theme is hackneyed: a northerner
attempts in vain to aid slaves to freedom, is won over
to the proslavery cause, and winds up by becoming a
confirmed slave dealer, inhumane because he was born
on the wrong side of the Ohio River. Justus, the
Yankee, tries to lure three Negroes to freedom.
Moses, the first, is a walking edition of <i>The Bible
Defense of Slavery</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Well, heah’s sump’n else, mastuh: we read in the book of
Leviticus dat de childin of Isr’l was told dey should buy slaves.
I marked de place, and I’ll jes read it to you; doe I s’pose you’s
seed it many a time. It’s in de twenty-fif’ chapter, de forty-fif’
and sixt’ verse.</p>
</div>

<p>Truly religious, Moses says that he submits because
the Bible tells him that such is his duty. Justus approaches
the second Negro with ludicrous pomp:
“Let an ardent desire to alleviate the woes of the
suffering plead my excuse for the breach of decorum.”
To this the Negro responds: “What for massah make
fun of puoh nigger dis way!” The third specimen,
farthest down in the physical and mental scale, runs
away with Justus, only to steal his horse and saddle-bags
and return to his master. Justus soon learns the
proslavery creed that freeing the Negro will merely
“people the penitentiary or feed the gibbet.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nature, by their inferior capacity and cheerful submission to
their lot, has so well fitted them for this position.... The lot of
the serving classes in all countries imposes a burden.</p>
</div>

<p>Grief is expressed for the white working class of the
North; the female slave finds no parallel to the degradation
of northern prostitutes. Abounding in such
arguments, <i>The Yankee Slave Dealer</i>, though poor in
characterization and plot, was the type of novel that
the South wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> Less novels than fictional arguments, the
first books of the plantation tradition are strikingly
similar. Frightened by the success of <i>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</i>, southern authors rushed counter-propaganda to
the presses. To testify to their culture, they produced
crude, ungainly works. They called Mrs. Stowe “a
moral scavenger” and worse names; since she was a
Yankee woman, the rules of chivalry could be suspended.
The pattern seldom varied: scenes of bliss
on the plantation alternated with scenes of squalor in
the free North. The contented slave, the clown and
the wretched freedman are the Negro stereotypes,
who put into dialect the creeds of Chancellor Harper
and Professor Dew in the <i>Pro-Slavery Argument</i>, and
of the Reverend Priest in <i>The Bible Defense of Slavery</i>.
A plantation with a kindly master was basis for
generalizing about all plantations, of whatever type,
in whatever sections. A pampered house-servant, who
refuses uncertain freedom for a comparatively easy
place, becomes <i>the</i> Negro slave; a poor unemployed
wretch becomes <i>the</i> freedman.</p>

<p>The intractable, the ironic, the abused Negro is
nowhere on these plantations. Congressmen might
deplore in legislative halls the injuries done the South
by the Underground Railroad, and southern newspapers
might be filled with descriptions of runaways,
some second offenders with branded scars on their
faces. But runaways in these books are generally
flighty creatures and half-wits, and even they finally
steal back to the South. Judicial records might be full
of instances of brutality, but the occasional whippings
are shown to be for due cause such as stealing a ham
from a poor woman who could not spare it. Miscegenation
is missing in spite of the proofs walking
about in the great houses or in the fields or the slave-pens.
Slavery is shown as a beneficent guardianship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
never as a system of cheap and abundant labor that
furnished the basis of a few large fortunes (and
assured an impoverished, disfranchised class of poor
whites).</p>

<p>In spite of the exaggerations and omissions, however,
certain damning evidence creeps in. Though too
kind to maltreat Negroes, the cavaliers are adept at
tarring-and-feathering, riding on rails, and lynching
abolitionist villains, probably out of consideration for
the Negro’s welfare. Slavery is sometimes considered
as not the Negro’s final state; at some indefinite time
(probably after the planters had all become wealthy)
he would be returned to Africa to bear witness to the
civilization and Christianity he had seen in America.
And lastly, the arguers are betrayed by their argumentative
tactics: It isn’t true; but since it is, you are
worse. Thus: it isn’t true that slavery is a bad system,
it is really a fine thing—no worse than the northern
and English system of wage-slavery, which is terrible.
Proslavery authors were justified in protesting the
exploitation of northern factory workers, but to argue
that therefore slavery was blessed, is to prove that a
man’s broken leg is not painful since another man has
a broken arm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c3">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">ANTISLAVERY FICTION</p>


<p><i>Growth of the Attitude.</i> The opposition to slavery,
which began almost as soon as the first slaves were
brought here, found literary expression in colonial
times and especially in the eighteenth century, when
honorable voices denounced slavery as “the most unremitting
despotism on the one hand, and degrading submissiveness
on the other.” It was not until the eighteen
thirties, however, that the antislavery crusade took on
full force, moving “from resistance to the slave power ... to
death to slavery.” In 1831, the year of Nat
Turner’s famous revolt, the Antislavery Society was
established, and William Lloyd Garrison published the
first number of his <i>Liberator</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to the pamphlets strewn on “the wayside,
the parlor, the stage coach, the rail car and the
boat deck,” slave narratives became a literary weapon.
The experiences of fugitive slaves intrigued abolitionists
who took down their stories, sometimes for newspaper
sketches such as Isaac Hopper’s <i>Tales of Oppression</i>,
and sometimes for fictionalized biographies
such as <i>A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of
Charles Ball, A Black Man</i> (1838), <i>Recollections of
Slavery</i> (attributed to a runaway slave, 1838) and
<i>The Narrative of James Williams</i> (1838). In 1839
Theodore Weld, as important in the antislavery crusade
as Garrison, produced <i>Slavery As It Is</i>, a book of
facts “authenticated by the slave-holders themselves
[yet containing] but a tiny fraction of the nameless
atrocities gathered from the papers examined.” Written
to combat “the old falsehood that the slave is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
kindly treated that has lullabied to sleep four-fifths of
the free North and West,” this was the most popular
antislavery publication before <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>.</p>

<p>When antislavery fiction appeared, therefore, it
found an audience prepared, and the arguments, the
characters and a literary form set up.</p>

<p><i>Before Uncle Tom’s Cabin.</i> The first antislavery
novel was published anonymously in 1836 as <i>The Slave</i>,
or <i>Memoirs of Archy Moore</i>. Enlarged in 1852, it
was renamed <i>The White Slave</i>, and claimed by Richard
Hildreth, the historian. Archy Moore, son of his
master, Colonel Moore, marries an octoroon, Cassy.
Forced to run away, since the colonel desires Cassy
for himself, they are captured and sold to different
masters. Archy is sold and resold, until in South
Carolina he and Tom, an embittered rebel, take to the
swamps, finding a colony of outlawed slaves. Ferreted
out of there, Archy, because of his light color, manages
to escape to the North; Tom becomes the wild scourge
of the region. Archy goes to Europe, attains some
education and wealth, and redeems his wife from
slavery. Though written in highflown language, and
not so dramatic as <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, <i>The White
Slave</i> is still vigorous. Certain characters—the white
slave, the octoroon girl, the insurrectionist, the unfeeling
Yankee overseer, and the lustful planter—are to
reappear in later novels. The arguments, though slowing
up the action, are cogent and informed. Hildreth
obviously studied the slaves in his sojourn: his delineation
includes hypocritical humility, sullenness, vindictiveness,
intractability, cunning, courage, the contempt
of house-servants for field hands, and of mulattoes for
darker Negroes. The loyalty of some slaves to their
masters, and their treachery to their fellows, are
explained largely as policy for gain. Although occasionally
heightened and unfair, <i>The White Slave</i> is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of the most important novels of this controversial
period.</p>

<p>Herman Melville’s allegory <i>Mardi</i> (1849) has bitter
antislavery protest and wise prophecy in the sections
that describe Vivenza (the United States). A slave
with red marks of stripes upon his back is observed
hoisting a standard, correspondingly striped, over the
Capitol, the temple dedicated to Liberty. Hieroglyphics
read “All men are born free and equal;”
minute hieroglyphics add “Except the tribe of Hamo.”
In the south of Vivenza, the strangers see</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Under a burning sun, hundreds of collared men ... toiling in
trenches.... Standing grimly over these, were men unlike them;
armed with long thongs, which descended upon the toilers.</p>
</div>

<p>After close scrutiny the strangers, in amazement, swear
that the slaves are men. For this they are branded as
“firebrands, come to light the flame of revolt.” The
southern spokesman exclaims: “The first blow struck
for them dissolves the Union of Vivenza’s vales. The
northern tribes well know it.” Melville warns northerners
not to feel self-righteous, and does not malign
southerners, since “the soil decides the man,” and they
have grown up with slavery. Some slaves even seem
happy, but Melville adds significantly “not as men.”
Melville is perplexed about the solution, and fatalistically
concludes that “Time must befriend these
thralls,” but he is certain that slavery is “a blot, foul
as the crater-pool of hell.”</p>

<p>The first woman to turn the novel to antislavery uses
was Emily Catherine Pierson, who felt that too few
readers knew of the thousands of runaways who had
gained freedom. <i>Jamie, The Fugitive</i> (1851) introduces
the hero in a newspaper advertisement of a
runaway, and takes leave of him in an invoice as one
of “Ten Bales of Humanity, in a thriving condition,
late from three plantations in Virginia.” In between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
we get descriptions of life in the cabins and fields, of
“nigger-buyers,” slave sales, slave-pens and caravans,
and of the hazards of the fugitive stealthily pursuing
his way under the “eaves of the Alleghanies,” befriended
only by the North Star. Mrs. Pierson’s book
is pious and sentimental, but her characters, though
slightly sketched, are believable human beings.</p>

<p>The same author writes in <i>Cousin Franck’s Household</i>
(1852):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Were we content to be an humble imitator, we know of no one
whom we should be prouder to follow than the noble author of
that wonderful work “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” But we owe it to
ourselves to say that our little book was projected before the
publication of the latter; and our Jamie Parker, we think, had
only one predecessor—and that we had not seen—in this species
of literature.</p>
</div>

<p>Written as the letters of a northern woman visiting
Virginia, <i>Cousin Franck’s Household</i>, or <i>Scenes In
The Old Dominion</i> is <i>Swallow Barn</i> in reverse. Slave-traders
and fugitives are again described. In addition
we have close observations of domestic life. Some of
the slaves, with good right, resemble the master too
much for his wife’s comfort and she begs him to sell
them or send them off to his Alabama plantation. A
slave drover remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fact is, I’ve got a specimen lot ... of Anglo-Saxon blood, I
reckon they calls it; at any rate, I’m takin’ ter market some of the
best blood in the “Old Dominion”.... Ingenus, ain’t it now,
for a body to tarn a body’s own blood to sich account.</p>
</div>

<p>A Yankee overseer, who “calculates what a nigger is
wuth, and how long he’ll last on the hard drive plan;”
a beautiful octoroon and her mother, crazy Millie,
deranged by the tragedy of slavery, are types that will
frequently be met with in later fiction. Although
apologetic to “fastidious readers” who might object
to her recording “dialectal peculiarities,” Mrs. Pierson
kept voluminous notebooks “to secure accuracy in the
nondescript vernacular of the cabin and the hut.” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
sees the social setting, likewise, with accuracy; she
records what southern novelists preferred not to show:
the poor whites, not an accident but a logical result of
slavery; and the worn-out, profitless land, which
brought it about that Virginia’s best crop was the crop
of slave children in the quarters.</p>

<p><i>Harriet Beecher Stowe.</i> In 1851, a little woman in
Cincinnati sent the first chapter of <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin
or The Man that Was a Thing</i> to the <i>National Era</i>.
The daughter of a famed preacher, and the sister of
another more famous for his antislavery sermons,
Harriet Beecher Stowe had grown up in religious,
humanitarian surroundings. Cincinnati, a border city,
was a battleground for antislavery and proslavery
forces; Dr. Bailey, abolitionist editor of the <i>National
Era</i> was mobbed there, and Quakers spread the antislavery
gospel in “sewing societies.” Mrs. Stowe,
whose home was at times a shelter for fugitives, had
listened to pathetic or hair-raising stories of the South,
and had written two antislavery sketches, “Immediate
Emancipator” (1848) and “The Freeman’s Dream”
(1850). Her anger at the passage of the Fugitive
Slave Law made her dissatisfied with such weak parables,
and she set out to write a passionate protest. In
preparation she read books like Weld’s <i>Slavery As It
Is</i>, and the autobiographies of Frederick Douglass, of
Lewis Clark, who suggested George Harris, and of
Josiah Henson, who suggested Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>In 1852 when the completed serial was published in
book form as <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin, or Life Among The
Lowly</i>, its success was instantaneous. Over three hundred
thousand copies were sold in America in the first
year; in a very short time there were forty editions in
England, and over a million and a half copies sold in
the Empire. It was translated in many foreign languages,
including Bohemian, Welsh and Siamese. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
was acclaimed by George Sand, Dickens and Kingsley,
who naturally were not annoyed by the sentimentality
and melodrama; it set Heinrich Heine to reading the
Bible; to Macaulay it was the greatest American
literary achievement. Whittier rejoiced in the Fugitive
Slave Law, since it gave occasion for the book.
Lincoln later said to Mrs. Stowe, “So you are the
little woman who brought on the great war.” If this
is overstatement, it is true that many of the voters
who elected Lincoln in 1860 were greatly influenced
by the household favorite. Tolstoy grouped it with the
few masterpieces of the world, and Howells considered
it the only great American novel produced before the
Civil War. Detractors have for a long time been
undermining its prestige, but it has probably been
more widely read than any other novel in the world,
and it is still popular.</p>

<p>In characterizing the Negroes in <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>,
Mrs. Stowe faced the dilemma of the propagandist.
If she showed them as brutalized by slavery, she would
have alienated her readers, whose preferences were
for idealized heroes. If on the other hand, she made
her characters too noble, her case against slavery
would be weakened. She did this with Uncle Tom,
and critics have stated: If slavery produced a Christian
hero so far superior to free whites, then slavery is
excellent. This dilemma was hardly recognized by Mrs.
Stowe, however, as all of her training and inclinations
were toward sentimental idealism. Eliza and George,
if not models of Christian forgivingness, are still
virtue in distress, to be saved by poetic justice. Eva’s
ethereal goodness, and Legree’s cruelty are examples
among the white characters of the same idealization.
But Topsy must not be overlooked; although minstrel
shows have made her into a Puck in blackface, Mrs.
Stowe intended to show her as a pathetic victim of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
slave-trading as well. Sambo and Quimbo, the slave-drivers,
had been dehumanized by the system; Cassy is
the octoroon whose beauty has crushed her; and Chloe,
while traditional, is made realistic by the little touches
of a woman well acquainted with kitchen-lore. Mrs.
Stowe has a wide range of Negro characters, and one
southern critic finds in <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> just about
all of the traits he is willing to grant the Negro. High
spirits are shown on Shelby’s Kentucky plantation, but
tragedy lurks in the background. Mrs. Stowe handles
the tragedy with the bold melodramatic strokes of
Dickens; but she artfully blends the shocking with
humor and pathos, with mystery and suspense; familiar
domestic scenes with cotton-planting, steamboating on
the river and gambling in New Orleans; pious moralizing
with fascinating wickedness—all in all a successful
recipe.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Stowe rattled the bones of the skeletons
in southern closets, howls arose from the manors. A
South Carolinian recorded the rumor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the whole “nigger kingdom” of the South had been killed,
smothered, torn to pieces by bloodhounds, ground up for bone
manure; children dragged from mothers’ breasts, and the whole
plantations turned into slaughter-houses, we fully expected; and
yet nobody had read it.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that no such pictures occurred in
<i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, yet Mrs. Stowe was called a defamer,
a hypocrite, “snuffling for pollution with a pious
air,” a plain liar.</p>

<p>A moralist and debater, Mrs. Stowe returned the lie.
She published <i>A Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, a book as
long as the novel, giving sources for all of her charges.
The <i>Key</i>, largely unread by the critics, remains unanswerable.
Granting that such feats as Eliza’s crossing
the ice are sensational, although vouched for, in what
did the lying in <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> consist? Joel
Chandler Harris goes too far in calling it a defense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of American slavery as Mrs. Stowe found it in Kentucky,
but his comment has point. Shelby and St. Clair
are kindly owners, in the plantation tradition, whose
humanity was overpowered by the system. The two
Yankees,—the vicious Legree and the priggish, unsympathetic
Miss Ophelia are certainly in line with southern
gospel. It is no lie that there were slave auctions,
slave cellars such as the ones where the flies “got to
old Prue,” public whipping posts, mothers separated
from their children, and slaves like Cassy whose beauty
was their doom. With allowances for sentimentality
and melodrama, essential truth is in <i>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</i>. To argue against its artistic faults and to consider
it incomplete representation are possible. The
charge of lying, however, is confusing. Mrs. Stowe
showed that slavery was a great wrong, and that
Negroes are human. Is it here that critics believe that
she lies?</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe’s second antislavery novel, <i>Dred, A Tale
of the Dismal Swamp</i> (1856) later published as <i>Nina
Gordon</i>, was obscured by the lasting fame of <i>Uncle
Tom’s Cabin</i>, although many critics have preferred it.
It lacks the pathos and sweep of the earlier work, but
it adds pictures of the “poor whites” and of Negro
outlaws in the Dismal Swamp. Harry Gordon is a
fuller portrait of George Harris; another “white
slave,” he is the successful manager of a plantation
while his white half-brother is a wastrel and carouser.
His character is analyzed in conventional terms: “the
rules about Ham do not pertain” to him, and at times
he plaintively wishes to be “a good, honest, black nigger,
like Uncle Pomp.” Lizette, his quadroon wife, is
similar to Eliza. Traditional Negroes are Old Hundred,
the coachman, and Tiff, who in his love for his
little white charges is like Uncle Tom. Dred, a fanatical
fugitive, the son of Denmark Vesey, is created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
somewhat after the model of Nat Turner. A new
figure for Mrs. Stowe, she does not portray him very
successfully. Devoted to the creed of “turning the
other cheek,” she shows Dred doing little other than
rescuing the virtuous, or urging slaves to escape. He is
less an insurrectionist than a Negro Robin Hood. His
supernatural appearances recall Scott’s novels, and his
longwinded chants are more those of a Hebrew prophet.
Other fugitives are more real: Hark, sullen and
inflexible, and Jim, the clownish house-servant, pampered
but wanting to be free, especially so that he can
have a wife all his own. There is local color in scenes
like the camp-meeting, but the book is written with a
reformer’s zeal, more concerned with urging emancipation
and denouncing “the great Christianizing institution”
than with re-creating social reality. Antislavery
feeling is likewise in <i>The Minister’s Wooing</i> (1859),
a tale of New England. Candace, “a powerfully built,
majestic black woman, corpulent, heavy,” is traditional
in her loyalty to her family, but she is proudly and
volubly free: “I ain’t a critter. I’s neider huff nor
horns. I’s a reasonable being....”</p>

<p><i>Negro Novelists.</i> Very shortly after <i>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</i> the first novel by an American Negro appeared.
This was <i>Clotel, or The President’s Daughter</i> (1853)
by William Wells Brown, an antislavery agent. The
book was popular enough for three editions; in the
second and third, the heroine is changed to the daughter
of “a great statesman.” <i>Clotel</i> is not well written
or well constructed, but these failings are common to
its type. Scattered throughout the book are intimate
glimpses that only one who had been a slave could get:
a few dialect rhymes, certainly among the first in
American literature, a few comic interludes, and some
Negro jokes on the master. But such things are all
too scarce. The story is melodrama, and the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
characters, though vouched for by the author, are
hardly distinguishable in gentility from the heroines
of “blood and tears” romances. Clotel’s mother jumps
into the Potomac, committing suicide to elude the
slave hunters. Her aunt, after marriage with a white
Vermont doctor, who neglects to file papers of manumission,
is sold with her beautiful daughters on the
block, and dies of the shame. The surpassingly beautiful
Clotel is luckier. Sold from one place to another,
she finally becomes maidservant for an angelic girl,
and falls in love with a handsome black slave. Helping
him to escape execution for resisting a white man, she
disguises him in her clothes, and remains undetected
in the cell. (She is nearly white, and he is black.) She
is flogged for this and sold to New Orleans, where an
enraptured Frenchman steals her away. After his
death, providential for the plot, she meets her former
lover in Europe. Back in America, he dies leading a
charge in the Civil War, and she becomes an Angel
of Mercy to the Federal troops. The novel wanders
far afield, and incidents that might have been impelling
arguments are told too casually.</p>

<p>Two other Negro novelists took up the novel as
their weapon. Frank J. Webb’s <i>The Garies and Their
Friends</i> (1857) takes place chiefly in Philadelphia. It
has a new setting and problem, but is badly overwritten.
Mr. Garie, a white man, has married a wife
only partly white, and race prejudice makes the whole
family suffer for it. In contrast, a Negro family lives
a happier life in spite of hardships. Martin Delany,
a versatile free Negro, began in 1859 a novel <i>Blake,
or the Huts of America</i> in the <i>Anglo-African</i>, but the
work was not completed. With a hero and heroine
modelled upon George Harris and Eliza, and a number
of horrors, <i>Blake</i> is an imitation of <i>Uncle Tom’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Cabin</i>, best in the pictures of the Southwest which
Delany had visited. In 1859 Frances Harper’s “The
Two Offers” appeared, telling of a white heroine who
devotes her life to the antislavery cause. This is the
first short story by a Negro author, but otherwise
unimportant.</p>

<p><i>Other Successors.</i> <i>The Planter’s Victim</i> (1855)
by W. W. Smith, republished five years later as the
<i>Yankee Slave Driver</i>, is the most gruesome antislavery
novel. Richard Dudley, wishing his octoroon half
sister for mistress, is infuriated when she marries a
nearly white slave, George. He has Caroline flogged
with one hundred and fifty lashes and George with
four hundred. On such a scale are all the barbarities
inflicted. Dudley smashes the skull of Caroline’s baby
and, when Caroline dies heartbroken, he insults her
corpse. For many years he torments George, and
finally after starving him in a New Orleans dungeon,
stabs him. The slaves are extreme specimens, George
being a “youthful and majestic Apollo in the full glow
of masculine beauty and splendor,” and Caroline being
magnificently beautiful. Both speak highflown drivel.
With all of his supposed manliness, George equals
Uncle Tom in saintliness. The book hardly serves its
purpose: the villains are too monstrous for belief, the
hero too submissive for respect, and the incidents too
uniformly gruesome for anything except a collection of
horrors.</p>

<p>Among the antislavery authors who, like Mrs.
Stowe, advocated colonization is H. L. Hosmer, author
of <i>Adela, The Octoroon</i> (1860). Adela, a slave-mistress,
though disliking abolitionist books which “merely
ransack lawsbooks and newspapers for narratives of
torture,” condemns slavery as a fraud and curse. The
misery of slaves on Mississippi plantations is pictured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
only a shade darker than the squalor of fugitives in
the North. The happy opportunities of life in Liberia
are set in contrast, but without conviction. One of the
full length characters is Tidbald, distinguished champion
of southern rights, but seducer of his own slave
daughter. A mysterious worker of the underground,
“broadbrim” Quakers, and an octoroon who preferred
to be a kept woman in New Orleans instead of a plantation
drudge, could well have been further developed
at the expense of the argumentation. Mention is made
of the melodies of the slaves and the rhythm of their
dancing, but other local color is missing and the dialect
is false. Many of the Negroes are true steel, game to
the core. At the end Adela is proved to be herself an
octoroon. To save her, a loyal body-servant, Captain
Jack, heads an insurrection and kills her would-be
ravisher. Although disgruntled at slavery, courageous,
and intelligent, Jack rebels only when his mistress is
in danger. <i>Adela, The Octoroon</i> is confused, incredible,
and tedious, with only occasional originality.</p>

<p>More popular among the Union soldiers, according
to report, than even <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, was a novel
published in the Beadle Dime Novel Series, <i>Maum
Guineas’ Children</i>, by Mrs. M. V. Victor (1861).
The author disclaims any political purpose, but her
stress is antislavery. While planters and their families
are shown in a sympathetic light, the abuses of slavery
are told of in fuller measure. Maum Guinea, mysterious
and embittered, has been deprived of her children
and husband. She contrives the escape of Hyperion
and Rose, a beautiful slave who has been sold by the
“kindly” master to a libertine. The novel deals with
the Christmas week in the lives of the slaves. Barbecuing,
dancing, singing, and hunting are described
to show the brighter side, but the stories told around
the fire are grim and rebellious. One slave’s husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
had been in the Nat Turner uprising; another had
attempted to kill his mistress, because she had jealously
hounded his mother to death. The novel is
simply written and evidently based upon intimate
knowledge. Mrs. Victor seems to look upon the pure
African type as happy-go-lucky, and finds rebels only
among the mixed bloods, and the happy ending is
forced. Even with these failings, however, the novel
belongs with the most readable and convincing of
antislavery novels.</p>

<p>Written to enforce the antagonism of many northerners
to the Fugitive Slave Law, since “a human
critter’s of more account than all the laws in Christendom,”
J. T. Trowbridge’s <i>Neighbor Jackwood</i> (1856)
is far more convincing in its pictures of Vermont than
of the deep South. Camille, the daughter of a Frenchman
and an octoroon <i>placée</i>, is “jest dark enough to be
ra’al purty.” Enslaved after her father’s death,
untimely as in so many abolitionist novels, she is sold
and is subjected to her master’s advances. Robert
Greenwood, a northerner, enamored of her, helps her
escape to the North; but unwilling to become his mistress,
she runs away from him. In Vermont she finds
honest love in Hector, who marries her, and goes South
to buy her freedom. Left in Vermont, she is hidden
away by Neighbor Jackwood, until Robert, now a full-fledged
scoundrel, tells the kidnappers where she is.
She is rescued in the nick of time by Hector, who brings
her papers of freedom. There is a great deal of mystery
and suspense, Camille’s hiding away in a haystack
on a stormy night being vividly described. But
the book is more sensational than revelatory of Negro
life; and the southern scenes are hastily passed over
and conventional.</p>

<p>The same author’s <i>Cudjo’s Cave</i> (1863), a stirring
boys’ book, tells of the conflicts between Unionists and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Confederates in Eastern Tennessee in the first year
of the war. Three Negro characters are prominent:
Toby, the faithful servant; Cudjo, ape-like in appearance,
but cunning, powerful, and vindictive, the
unbroken African; and Pomp, “magnificently proportioned,
straight as a pillar, and black as ebony, of noble
features.” Pomp has been educated abroad by an
indulgent master. As usual in these novels, the benefactor
dies, and the new master is tyrannical. Pomp
escapes to the ravines of the Cumberland Mountains,
and there meets Cudjo, whose scarred back was “the
most powerful of antislavery documents.” They eke
out an existence in the cave, with the connivance of
slaves who keep them posted; in their turn they help
runaways, succor abolitionists is distress, and finally
aid in overthrowing the Confederate guerrillas. The
Negroes and the Unionists are too good, and the
Rebels too villainous, but the novel has the suspense
of escape and capture, and throws light upon an interesting
chapter of history.</p>

<p>In spite of its unwieldy plot, Epes Sargent’s <i>Peculiar</i>
(1863) is one of the most rewarding of antislavery
novels. It is not a mere recounting of horrors. “It
ain’t de whippins ... dat make de wrong of slavery.
De mos’ kindest thing dey could do de slave would be
ter treat him so he wouldn’t stay a slave nohow,” says
one character. Another insists that if slaves were so
brutalized as to be contented, slavery would be doubly
cursed, and rejoices that “there is manhood in them
to make them at least unhappy.” The slave Peek,
named for the “Peculiar Institution,” has full share of
this manhood, and is defiant, provident, intelligent,
and, strangely for the antislavery gallery, skeptical of
religion. Vance, the white hero, disguises himself as
Gashface, a mulatto underground agent, out of hatred
for the system that had killed his octoroon wife. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and Peek, as climax to their safeguarding the virtuous,
and confounding wrong-doers, discover a beautiful
white girl who had been sold into slavery, and rescue
her from the lust of her master. The story is sensational,
but Sargent shows an understanding of such
historic matters as the kidnapping from northern
States, the workings of the underground, and the easy
acceptance of concubinage by southern society. He
shows the slaves to be secretive, relying on their
“grapevine telegraph” for mutual protection; slyly
humorous, waging their own guerrilla warfare against
a stronger enemy. Sargent goes below the surface and
gets at social causes, and because of this his book is
frequently persuasive.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> Antislavery fiction naturally concentrated
upon the abuses that proslavery fiction left
unmentioned: slave-sales, the breaking up of families,
shameful practises at the slave-mart, slave jails and
coffles, whippings, overwork and concubinage. Slave
discontent was stressed. Negro insurrectionists, outlaws,
fugitives and underground agents are favorite
characters, and since they existed in large numbers,
antislavery fiction makes a contribution here to realism.
Unfortunately the rebellious and militant are
generally shown to be of mixed blood, like George
Harris, whereas the more African type is shown as
docile, like Uncle Tom. Some novelists depart from
this pattern, but the pattern persists and has remained
wrongly influential. Moreover, the heroine is frequently
a quadroon or octoroon, a concession, unconscious
perhaps, to race snobbishness even among
abolitionists. As one critic says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This was an indirect admission that a white man in chains
was more pitiful to behold than the African similarly placed.
Their most impassioned plea was in behalf of a person little
resembling their swarthy protégés....</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>
<p>The plots are strained and melodramatic. Too often
the kindly disposed master dies suddenly, without
having chance to fulfill his promises of freedom. Too
often, on the other hand, the slave’s problems are
solved by breaks of good luck at the book’s end.</p>

<p>Antislavery fiction set up the stereotypes of “the
victim”, “the noble savage” sometimes “the perfect
Christian,” and the “tragic octoroon.” The items of its
denunciation are true enough to history, but they do
not represent the real gamut of Negro life and character.
The large plantation, where the abuses incidental
to absentee ownership throve, is still the chief
setting, and the smaller, more typical farm is neglected.
The workaday life of the average slave, who, through
fear, ignorance, loyalty or habit did not revolt or run
away, and who learned to accommodate himself so
that the whippings and penalties would be less, is missing.
Often, too, antislavery fiction, by stressing physical
punishments, underemphasizes the greater wrongs,
the destruction of manhood, and the ugly code of
morality that slavery fostered. Certain articles of the
southern creed were accepted too easily, such as the
belief that the slave-trader was a low boor, unaccepted
socially by the aristocrats. Modern scholars, such as
Frederic Bancroft in <i>Slave Trading in the Old South</i>,
have shown how some of the “finest” southern families
built up their wealth from slave dealing.</p>

<p>It might be expected in the “battle of the books”
that proslavery authors would have an advantage in
being on the scene. But full or even partial use was not
made of this advantage, the dialect and local color of
the proslavery authors being very little better than
and frequently not so good as those of the abolitionists.
Except for Mrs. Schoolcraft, Harriet Beecher
Stowe writes better dialect than proslavery authors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Hildreth and Mrs. Victor obviously knew southern
life. In their total presentation of social setting, the
abolitionists have not been so one-sided as their detractors
have made out. Many show good masters as
well as bad, attacking a system rather than the people.
For comic relief, or for honest realism, many present
happier scenes, but wisely present these as holidays, not
as the reality of slavery. Most important, however, is
the difference in characterization. Lowell said that
Mrs. Stowe’s genius “instinctively goes right to the
organic elements of human nature, whether under a
white skin or black;” and at their best the other antislavery
authors do like wise. When a mother is separated
from her child, they show the grief of a bereft
mother, not a mother of peculiar racial endowments
who cannot love her children because she and they
happen to be black. If she is not grief-stricken, they
lay the blame upon the brutalizing of slavery, not on a
racial characteristic that it soothed slave-holders to
believe in. The antislavery authors may not ever have
owned Negroes, but they started from the premise that
Negroes were human. Finally, it must be said that
although both sides went in for melodrama and idealizing,
the antislavery case was much more credible.
Facts, even in spite of <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, are
abolitionist.</p>

<p class="c">RECONSTRUCTION: THE GLORIOUS SOUTH</p>


<p><i>The Triumph of The Tradition.</i> If <i>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</i> triumphed in the antebellum “battle of the
books,” being widely remembered while its opponents
are forgotten, the plantation tradition was to score a
signal victory in the Reconstruction. Although no
longer needed to defend a tottering institution, it was
now needed to prove that Negroes were happy as
slaves and hopelessly unequipped for freedom, so that
slavery could be resurrected in practise though not in
name. Ancestor worshippers, the sons of a fighting
generation, remembering bitterly the deaths of their
fathers, uncles, or brothers, the sufferings of their
families and themselves, brought the passion of the
defeated to their descriptions. Many, politically
astute, used the plantation tradition to further their
ambitions.</p>

<p>The authors of the reconstruction were better
writers than their antebellum predecessors. Moreover,
they were farther from slavery, and since their
memories were often those of childhood, they idealized
to a much greater degree. Some proslavery authors,
like William Thompson, had admitted, for instance,
that many slaves had the harshest kind of masters;
others unconsciously allowed facts to enter that their
descendants considered too uncouth for mention.
Nostalgic yearning brought it about that, according to
Gaines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Slavery was softened until whatever may have been evil was
regarded as accidental.... The scale of life was steadily
enlarged, the colors were made increasingly vivid. Estates swelled
in size and mansions grew proportionately great. Gentlemen were
perfected in courtly grace, gay girls in loveliness, slaves in
immeasurable devotion.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>With the seductiveness of any past seen through
“the golden haze of retrospect,” with realism to the
surface of Negro life, disarmingly affectionate references
to Negroes of the old school, and a mastery of
the tricks of fiction, the plantation tradition came into
its own. The Negro was established as contented
slave, entertaining child and docile ward, until misled
by “radical” agitators, when he became a dangerous
beast.</p>

<p><i>Local Color.</i> Following Bret Harte’s discovery of
the picturesque and quaint in California’s past, local
colorists sprang up all over the nation. Many southern
regions were staked out as claims worth mining.
Charles Egbert Craddock in the Tennessee mountains,
Mark Twain in the Mississippi valley, George Washington
Cable in fabulous New Orleans brought the
wealth of their discoveries to a literature that had
fallen on lean years. Coincidentally with the rise of
the local colorists, a new interest in the South, the
scene of America’s greatest war, was awakening. Magazines,
especially <i>Scribner’s</i>, attempted to slake this
curiosity. A great outburst of dialect stories resulted.
Among the first of the writers to realize the picturesque
interest of the southern Negro was Sherwood
Bonner (Mrs. Katherine McDowell), a pioneer in
local color fiction as Russell was in poetry (she had
even written dialect poetry of the Negro before Russell’s
book appeared). Many of her <i>Dialect Tales</i>
(1878) and <i>Suwanee River Tales</i> (1884) are about
Negroes. They are interesting as first attempts, but
they illustrate the chief weaknesses of local color: they
reveal odd turns of speech and customs but the characterization
is superficial and condescending. Southern
local colorists were soon to sweep the North with a
different formula; fidelity to speech and manners was
to be combined with regret “for the dear dead days
beyond recall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p><i>Thomas Nelson Page.</i> Most elegiac of these
authors, and probably most persuasive in casting a
golden glow over the antebellum South is Thomas
Nelson Page. With a mastery of pathos and stirring
melodrama, his <i>In Ole Virginia</i> (1887) sets a pattern
that time has not been able to wear out. The three best
known stories of this volume are “Marse Chan,”
“Meh Lady,” and “Unc’ Edinburg’s Drownin’.” They
are told in the dialect of eastern Virginia, accurately
recorded. The literary device used in all three stories
is quite simple: an old Negro, garrulous in praise of
the old days, tells a tale of handsome cavaliers and
lovely ladies, with stress upon the love between master
and slave. Marse Chan saves a slave’s life at the cost
of his own sight; Uncle Edinburg is saved by his young
master from a raging torrent; Uncle Billy defends his
charges from marauding Yankee soldiers, and supports
them after the war. The stories end in lovers’
meetings; as in Shakespeare, the courtship of lord and
lady is balanced by the comical courtship of the servants.
Page has his three ventriloquist’s dummies agreeing
upon the blessedness of slavery. Sam says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dem wuz good ole times, marster—de bes’ Sam ever see! Dey
wuz, in fac’! Niggers didn’t hed nothing ’tall to do.... Dyar
warn’ no trouble nor nothin’.</p>
</div>

<p>Uncle Edinburg seconds the emotion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh! nuttin’ warn’ too good for niggers dem times; an’ de
little niggers wuz runnin’ roun’ right ’stracted.... Dis nigger
ain’ nuver gwine forgit it.”</p>
</div>

<p>And Uncle Billy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wuz settin’ in de do’ wid meh pipe, an heah ’em settin’ dyah
on de front steps, dee voices soun’in low like bees, an’ de moon
sort o’ mellow over de yard, an’ I sort o’ got to studyin’ an’ hit
pear like de plantation live once mo’, an’ de ain’ no mo’ scufflin’,
an de ol times done come back agin....</p>
</div>

<p>“No Haid Pawn,” a ghost story in the same volume,
has a Negro character who differed from other slaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
in that he was without amiability or docility, superstition
or reverence. Page adds significantly, “He was
the most brutal negro I ever knew.” <i>The Negro: The
Southerner’s Problem</i> states Page’s lavish praise for
the “old time darky” and his virulent disgust at the
“new issue,” ruined by emancipation; <i>Red Rock</i>
(1898) embodies this hatred in fiction. The docile
mastiffs have become mad dogs; the carriers of the
rabies are Yankee soldiers and schoolmarms, carpet-baggers,
and scalawags. Mammy Krenda, Waverly,
Tarquin, and Jerry are sympathetically treated because
they despise the northern interlopers, and stand hand-in-hand
before quality. Less servile Negroes are called
insolent swaggerers. Moses, a mulatto trick doctor,
is the worst of these. He orates: “I’m just as good as
any white man.... I’m goin’ to marry a white ’ooman
and meck white folks wait on me.” Within a few pages
he is likened to “a hyena in a cage,” “a reptile,” “a
species of worm,” “a wild beast.” He attempts to
assault one of the heroines, the daughter of an abolitionist
mother; this Page considers a fit harvest for
interference with the most chivalrous of civilizations.
Page thus anticipates such authors as Thomas Dixon
whose stock in trade is the brute Negro, and whose pat
response to any assertion of Negro rights is the cry
of intermarriage or rape.</p>

<p>Such a volume as <i>Pastime Stories</i> (1894) deals less
with the good times than with Page’s own days.
The Negro characters are petty thieves and drunkards,
but are dealt with jocularly. There is ridicule in Uncle
Jack’s “Views on Geography”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You knows de way to de spring and de wood-pile, an’ de mill,
an’ when you gits a little bigger I’s gwine to show you de way
to de hoe-handle, an’ de cawn-furrer, an’ dat’s all de geog-aphy
a nigger’s got to know.</p>
</div>

<p>One story shows approvingly how a mulatto office-seeker
is thwarted by a faithful Negro for the sake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of his master’s political advantage. <i>Bred in the Bone</i>
(1904) adds nothing to Page’s usual characterizations,
dealing largely with the antics of comic menials.</p>

<p><i>Harris.</i> It was from the slave quarters that Joel
Chandler Harris started his trip to literary immortality.
As a lonely boy, shy with people of his own race,
he turned for companionship to the cabins on a
Georgia plantation. There he met Uncle George Terrell,
the original of Uncle Remus; there he started his
long study of Negro lore, and there he learned something
of the story-telling art and something of his
wisdom. For years the slaves had been telling fables
of Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox and Brer Terrapin, some of
the stories having come from Africa. But no one had
dug in this mine before Harris. A true artist, he recognized
the value of what he found. He is more than
a reteller, however; he altered, adapted, polished and
sharpened until the products differ from folk tales.
For all of the fascination of Brer Rabbit and company,
the fabler is stressed more than the characters.
Instead of being by the folk for the folk, Uncle Remus
tells the stories to entertain a white child. Harris lost
something authentic when he adopted this framework,
but he gained Uncle Remus. And Uncle Remus is
worth gaining. By no means the typical product of
slavery, as Harris implies, he is still finely conceived:
a venerable, pampered Negro with a gift for quaint
philosophizing and for poetic speech, having (or
allowed to have) only pleasant memories, fortunate
above his brothers—one of the best characters in
American literature.</p>

<p>In folk-idiom, the tales are kept close to the people.
No author before Harris had recorded Negro speech
with anything like his skill. Walter Hines Page stated:
“I have Mr. Harris’ word for it that he can <i>think</i> in
the Negro dialect. He could translate even Emerson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
perhaps Bronson Alcott in it....” Any random
excerpt will reveal this ability:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bimeby, one day, after Brer Fox bin doin’ all dat he could fer
ter ketch Brer Rabbit, en Brer Rabbit bin doin’ all he could fer to
keep ’im fum it, Brer Fox say to hisse’f dat he’d put up a game
on Brer Rabbit, en he ain’t mo’n got de wuds out’n his mouf
twel Brer Rabbit come a lopin up de big road, lookin’ des ez
plump en ez fat, en ez sassy ez a Moggin hoss in a barley
patch....</p>

<p>“All right, Brer Fox, but you better holler fum whar you stan’.
I’m monstus full er fleas dis mawnin’,” sez Brer Rabbit, sezee.</p>
</div>

<p>Strewn through the stories is much local color, well-observed
and true. Fine turns of speech reveal the
slave’s mind. The use of Brer Rabbit as the hero is
noteworthy. Forced to pit his cunning against enemies
of greater physical strength, he was perhaps a symbol
for people who needed craft in order to survive. But
whether victor over Brer Wolf, or victim to the Tar-baby,
he is a likeable scamp, who has come loping
lickety-split down the years.</p>

<p>Before finishing his long cycle of tales, Uncle Remus
revealed himself more thoroughly than any preceding
Negro character. But Harris was a journalist, as well
as a writer of fiction, and he was called upon to give
his version of the critical times. It was here that his
ability to translate anything into Negro dialect was
misused. He made Uncle Remus the mouthpiece for
defending orthodox southern attitudes. Needless to
say, Uncle Remus diminishes in stature; he becomes
less a man, more a walking delegate. The old man
keeps his hat in his hand too much. He defends the
glory of the Old South, he admires his white folks,
he satirizes education for Negroes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hit’s de ruinashun er dis country.... Put a spellin’-book
in a nigger’s han’s, en right den en dar’ you loozes a plow-hand....
What’s a nigger gwineter ’larn outen books? I kin take a
bar’l stave an’ fling mo’ sense inter a nigger in one minnit dan
all de schoolhouses betwixt dis en de State er Midgigin.... Wid
one bar’l stave I kin fa’rly lif’ de vail er ignunce.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
<p>When Negroes migrated for better working conditions,
or out of fear, Uncle Remus almost frantically
begs them to “stay off them kyars.” That an old
Negro, spoiled by his white-folks, and patronized by
southern journalists, might say what his hearers want
to hear, and even believe it, is quite probable. But as
racial adviser, Uncle Remus forfeits our trust in him;
he is too fluently the mouthpiece of southern policy.
He did better telling how Brer Rabbit fooled Brer
Fox by slick talk, or when he said: “Watch out we’en
you’er gittin’ all you want. Fattenin’ hogs ain’t in
luck.”</p>

<p>Many of Harris’s other stories repeat usual characters
in usual situations. In “Aunt Fountain’s Prisoner”
the old auntie saves a Yankee’s life and presides
over his successful courtship of a southern girl.
“Mingo” tells of a slave of “meritorious humility,”
“a cut above” the Negroes who accepted freedom. In
“Baalam and His Master,” Baalam, of a “fearlessness
rare among slaves” fights alongside his roistering
master in tavern brawls and digs a hole in the wall of
a jail to be near him. Although Ananias is mean-looking,
his sacrifice for his master, ruined by the war,
proves him to be an old familiar, merely with a new
face. Like the typical southern authors of his time,
Harris does not show the Negro who would fight or
work or exercise his wits in his own cause.</p>

<p>A few runaways and freed Negroes attracted his
attention. Free Betsey in <i>Sister Jane</i> and Mink in
<i>On the Plantation</i> are as devoted to their little missy
and massa, however, as Uncle Remus. “Free Joe” is
the pathetic story of a freed Negro, feared by the
whites and avoided, but hardly envied, by the slaves.
After his wife was sold by a master well nicknamed
Old Spite, and his faithful little dog was killed by Old
Spite’s hounds, he dies, heartbroken. Humane and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
intelligent, Harris uses “Free Joe” to attack the popular
notion that Negroes always “grin at trouble.” The
forces making a free Negro an outcast are clearly
indicated. But dyed-in-the-wool southerners could use
Joe’s shiftlessness to prove that a freed Negro could
not stand alone, and Harris’s picture of the laughing,
singing slaves who despised Free Joe might bear
them out. Joe is certainly not a typical free Negro,
but the sympathy in his portrait is deeper than any of
Harris’s contemporaries dared show.</p>

<p>“Mom Bi” tells of an unusual mammy. In spite
of her withered arm, Mom Bi is a black Amazon, with
eyes that “shone like those of a wild animal not afraid
of the hunter.” She was not religious:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ef de Lawd call me in de chu’ch I gwine, ef he no call I no
gwine, enty? I no yerry him call dis long time....</p>
</div>

<p>Whoever crossed her—white or black, old or young—got
a piece of her mind. She outspokenly scorns
the South Carolina “sandhillers” or “tackies,” and
laughs at them for going to war to “fight for rich
folks’ niggers.” In the Civil War she is a grim prophet
of Yankee victory, and therefore is considered a
lunatic. Again, however, Harris cannot shake off the
heavy hand of tradition. Mom Bi forgives the sale of
her daughter Maria, but is grieved that her young
master Gabriel was killed in battle, fighting alongside
of poor white folks. Emancipated, she goes down to
live with Maria, her daughter; when smallpox kills
off Maria and her children, she returns (as do most
of the Negroes whom Harris likes) to the old homeplace.
“I done bin come back,” says she. “I bin come
back fer stay, but I free, dough!”</p>

<p>Like “Mom Bi,” “Blue Dave” promises much more
than it gives. Dave, an inky black powerfully built
runaway, has become a legend before the story opens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
for fearlessness and terrorism. In the story proper,
however, we merely get a Hercules devoted to a family
because the young master resembles a former Virginian
owner. Dave has said over and over again that
slavery “ain’t no home for me,” but he is bought by
the family he has served, and lives happily ever after
as a model slave. “Where’s Duncan,” more than any
other of Harris’s stories, touches upon the sinister and
repellent. A swarthy dark-bearded vagabond fiddler
tells mysteriously of a planter who sold his son to a
trader. The last scene, recalling Poe’s effects, shows
an old mansion afire; in the light of the flames, a
mulatto woman cries out “Where’s Duncan?” and
stabs the white father of her son with a carving knife.
Crooked-leg Jake saw Duncan, the fiddler, sitting in a
corner, seemingly enjoying the spectacle.</p>

<p>The last story shows that Harris saw in slavery
something more than a perpetual Mardi Gras; he knew
that there was hatred as well as mutual affection, the
ugly as well as the pleasant. Harris promised “scenes
such as have never been described in any of the books
that profess to tell about life in the South before the
war.” But with all of his value as a realist, Harris
never came fully to grips with the reality of the South
or of Negro experience. He was a kindly man, and
wished the wounds of war bound up. He could give
some praise to Negroes struggling to achieve property
and education. But he was a southerner, living in
vexatious times, and therefore his fiction almost always
glorified the faithful self-denying slave of the old
South, for whom the old ways of slavery were the best.
He achieved a fine portrait in Uncle Remus, but Uncle
Remus had brothers and children of a different stamp,
whom Harris touched gingerly, if at all. Harris came
a good distance down the road toward fairness if compared
with Thomas Nelson Page. But compared with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
George Washington Cable and Mark Twain, he still
lagged behind.</p>

<p>Harris recorded some of the folk-lore of the “saltwater”
Negroes with success, but it remained for
Charles C. Jones to do the fuller job in <i>Negro Myths
from the Georgia Coast</i> (1888). These tales are
worthy to stand by those of Uncle Remus and, lacking
the editorializing, are closer to the originals. They
are told in the unique lingo of the rice-field and sea-island
Negroes. The first in the “untrodden field of
the swamp region of Georgia and the Carolinas,”
Jones discovered what later folk-lorists like Samuel
Stoney, Gertrude Shelby and Ambrose Gonzales have
found attractive.</p>

<p><i>Edwards.</i> Harry Stillwell Edwards belongs to the
long line of Georgians from Longstreet down to
Erskine Caldwell who write of the Old South with
more realism and less worship. His Major Crawford
Worthington, for instance, is a portly, profane, self-willed
sportsman who considers the Negro an unfailing
source of amusement. Worthington’s slave Isam is an
annual runaway, not because slavery is harsh, but
because he likes vacations. “The Two Runaways” tells
of a vacation on which master and slave, boon companions,
live high on stolen corn and melons. They
enjoy seeing each other in difficulties. When a buck
deer and the fat major are wrestling, Isam, a safe,
happy ringsider, cries out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Stick ter ’im Mass Craffud, stick ter ’im! Hit’s better fer one
ter die den bofe! Hole ’im Mass Craffud.... Wo’ deer! Stick
ter ’im, Mass Craffud, steddy!</p>
</div>

<p>Tables are turned in “The Woodhaven Goat” when a
goat, maddened by bees, butts and drags Isam all
over the yard. From beneath the house, the Major</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>looked out through tears with a sudden delight at the negro’s
predicament, sobbing and choking with emotion ... he frantically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
beat the dry soil about him with his fist for some moments.
“Better for one to die than two.... Stick to him, Isam.... Whoa,
goat!”</p>
</div>

<p>“Aeneas Africanus” (1920) humorously tells of a
black Eneas, who confused by the duplication of town-names,
covered 3350 miles through seven states, over
a period of eight years, trying to get back to his
quality whitefolks. Like his Major, Edwards seemed
to have studied the Negro only on his amusing side.
But he was willing to poke fun at some of the absurdities
of the Old South, and his robust horseplay is a
relief from sentimentality.</p>

<p><i>F. Hopkinson Smith.</i> Few authors dealt with a
rough-and-ready friendship between a swearing master
and a none-too-obsequious slave in the manner of
Edwards. More typical is the sentimental, genteel
treatment of mutual affection as in <i>Colonel Carter of
Cartersville</i> by F. Hopkinson Smith (1891), a portrait
of a quixotic Virginia gentleman and his devoted
servant, Chad. Chad exists only to prepare choice
dishes of canvas-back duck and terrapin for his moneyless
but epicurean master, to support the colonel’s
hospitality with his pitiful stored earnings, to be a
bulwark against the harsh Yankee world, and to
express his disdain for people who are “not quality.”
With his wife Henny, a similar model of loyalty, he
furnishes comic relief and glorifies the “good old
days.” <i>Colonel Carter’s Christmas</i> (1903) adds little
to the characterization of the sentimental pair.</p>

<p><i>James Lane Allen.</i> Sentimentalist and idealist,
James Lane Allen could find little blemish in the antebellum
South according to “Uncle Tom At Home in
Kentucky”, his refutation of Mrs. Stowe. “Two Gentlemen
of Kentucky” (1888) tells of the great affection
between a sweet Kentucky Colonel—so unworldly
that when he runs a store he chivalrously gives away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the wares—and his faithful servant, Peter Cotton.
Peter is completely self-forgetful, but must be made
ludicrous as well. His blue-jeans coat, with very long
and spacious tails, is embroidered with scriptural texts,
the word “Amen” being located just “over the end of
Peter’s spine.” The master’s death is followed in
a year by Peter’s. The world after the Civil War
was no fit place for these two, which is no great reflection,
since too often they act like halfwits. In “King
Solomon of Kentucky” (1891) a free Negro woman,
who has made some money selling cakes and pies, buys
a white vagabond on the block, because he was a friend
of her dead Virginia master. The vagabond is regenerated
and becomes the town hero in a cholera epidemic.
The introduction of the auction block is
almost unmatched in plantation tradition literature,
but it is significant that a white man is the one sold
from it.</p>

<p><i>Grace King and Kate Chopin.</i> In resentment at
Cable’s attacks upon the plantation tradition, discussed
in the next chapter, many southerners set up
Grace King and Kate Chopin as more truthful observers
of Louisiana. Undoubtedly both are more traditional.
Few troubles fret the slaves in Grace King’s
stories, except in the case of octoroons who grieve
that they are not white. “Monsieur Motte” tells
of a Negro woman, Marcelite, who supports in a
fashionable school the daughter of her dead mistress,
pretending that money comes from a non-existent
uncle, Monsieur Motte. In <i>Balcony Stories</i> (1893),
Joe is likewise the devoted servant, begging to be sold
because his master’s widow is in need of money. “A
Crippled Hope” tells of a Negro girl, whose value
as a nurse for sick slaves in the auction mart keeps
her from being sold to “delicate ladies,” whom she
would have loved to serve. When freedom comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
she does not want it; she only wants to succor the
ailing. “The Little Convent Girl” is about a sad-faced
girl, who is suddenly discovered to have a negro
mother. The girl drowns, escaping her fate. Even
at the age of twelve, a tragic octoroon! Negroes
not octoroons have a merry time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And then what a rolling of barrels, and shouldering of sacks,
and singing of Jim Crow Songs, and pacing of Jim Crow steps;
and black skins glistening through torn shirts, and white teeth
gleaming through red lips, and laughing, and talking ... bewildering,
entrancing!</p>
</div>

<p>Kate Chopin was a sensitive, skillful teller of tales.
Her <i>Bayou Folk</i> (1894) is a collection laid in and
around Natchitoches Parish near Red River, of which
she presents the local customs and patois admirably.
But the Negroes she portrays are still models of
loyalty and self-denial. In “A No Account Creole,”
La Chatte, a broad black mammy, is guardian over
the love affairs of the white creoles. “In and Out of
Old Natchitoches” shows a fiery plantation owner
who for a time flouts the community taboo of consorting
with mulattoes. “In Sabine” depicts Uncle
Mortimer protecting a white woman who is abused
by her hard drinking husband. “Beyond the Bayou”
shows a gaunt, black woman overcoming her extreme
fear of the bayou to carry home a little white child
whom she loves. “The Benitou’s Slave” pictures
extreme devotion. “Desirée’s Baby”, probably Mrs.
Chopin’s best known work, deals with a young creole
husband and wife to whom is born a child who gives
evidence of Negro blood. The outraged husband
sends his wife away in disgrace. He then, discovers,
through an old letter, that the Negro blood came from
his own mother; she was thankful, she said, that her
son would never know.</p>

<p>Of the numerous short stories defending the Old
South space forbids more than mention of a selected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
few. Maurice Thompson in “Ben and Judas” (1889)
wrote a good story of a mutual affection between
owner and owned. In “The Balance of Power,”
Thompson has a crafty Negro, who walks on “bofe
sides of de fence,” managing it so that the young man
wins the beautiful girl while her father is conceded
the election. The story is inconsequential, but it
does show the colonel winning political support by
stating that his rival is supported by Negroes. Of
a different type is “An Incident” by Sarah Barnwell
Elliott, which dramatizes the terror at the “brute”
Negro, and is concerned with “what answer the future
would have for this awful problem.”</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> Plantation tradition fiction of the
Reconstruction added realism of speech and custom,
but with few exceptions, this realism was subordinated
to the purpose of showing the mutual affection between
the races which the North had partly destroyed in a
foolish war. Negro characters, at their best, are
shown only in relationship with kindly southern whites;
at their worst, in relationship with predatory Yankees.
They are never shown in relationship to themselves.
They are confined to the two opposite grooves
of loyalty or ingratitude. The authors, remembering
their childhood when it is likely that they had Negro
playmates as boon companions, made slavery a boyish
romp. It was flattering to believe that their fathers
and mothers were objects of universal love and worship.
It was charming for a man accustomed to
deference and submission to believe these to be
ordained in heaven. It was uncomfortable to believe
that irony, or shrewd appraisal could lurk behind the
bland smile, the pull on the forelock, the low curtsey.
Perish the thought! A kindly critic of the South
paraphrases the legend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Way down upon the Suwanee River the sun shines bright on
my old Kentucky home, where, bound for Louisiana, Little Eva<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
has a banjo on her knee, and Old Black Joe, Uncle Remus and
Miss Sally’s little boy listen to the mocking-bird and watch a
sweet chariot swing low one frosty mornin’. The gallant Pelham
and his comrades bend forever over the hands of adorable girls
in crinoline; under the duelling oaks Colonel Carter of Cartersville
and Marse Chan blaze away at each other with pistols by
the light of the silvery moon on Mobile Bay ...</p>
</div>

<p>And we might add: the happy slaves are forever singing
in the beautiful fields of white cotton, and forever
black mammies fondle their little marses and missies
and exude love for all the rich folks in Dixie, and body
servants rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
serve their beloved masters until death let them
depart in peace, to serve in heaven, forever and ever.</p>


<p class="c p2">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</p>

<p>1. Why was the earlier plantation tradition fiction
less persuasive than that written in Reconstruction?</p>

<p>2. What were reasons why the “brute” Negro was
seldom mentioned in antebellum fiction, and so frequently
mentioned in Reconstruction?</p>

<p>3. What in the testimony of Page’s three Uncles
supports the fact that Virginia was a slave-breeding
state?</p>

<p>4. Compare Harris and Page.</p>

<p>5. Why is Edwards closer to the “frontier humorists”
than to Allen?</p>

<p>6. Since instances of mutual affection in slavery
could undoubtedly be found, why should not literature
celebrating it be considered a trustworthy guide
to the Old South?</p>

<p>7. List the runaways and “bad Negroes” mentioned
in this chapter, with the authors’ characterizations of
them.</p>

<p>8. Account for the absence of characters of mixed
blood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">RECONSTRUCTION: THE NOT SO GLORIOUS SOUTH</p>


<p><i>Cable.</i> Although he had served as an officer in the
Confederate Cavalry, George Washington Cable was
aware of much that was wrong in the old South and
the new. His <i>The Silent South</i> and <i>The Negro Question</i>
are antidotes to Page’s dangerous drugs; against
the convict lease system, for instance, Cable wrote with
startling pertinence even for our own day. Cordially
hated in the South, he took up residence in Massachusetts,
but though in “exile” he kept close to his heart
the best interests of his section.</p>

<p>Praised as the first southerner to include just and
sympathetic recognition of the Negro, Cable portrays
Negroes or the background of slavery in most
of his novels. For our purposes <i>Old Creole Days</i>
(1879) and <i>The Grandissimes</i> (1880) are most
important. <i>Old Creole Days</i> re-creates, with vivid
local color, early nineteenth century Louisiana. In
“Posson Jone”, a faithful servant outwits the sharpers
who were preying upon his master; if the situation is
old, the details are sharply observed. Less kindly
pictures of slavery appear in “’Tite Poulette” and
“Madame Delphine”, stories of octoroons of a warm
seductive beauty, cultivated with care so that they
may be “protected” by some Louisiana grandee. This
“protection” does not keep tragedy from their lives,
however. To these women, says Cable, “every white
man in this country is a pirate.” Therefore, both
mothers in these stories pretend that their daughters
are not really theirs, in order that the girls may get
around the law that rigorously forbade marriage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
octoroons to “pure whites.” Bitterly acquainted with
what faces her lovely daughter, Delphine cries out
against the law “to keep the two races separate”: “A
lie, Pere Jerome! Separate! No-o-o! They do not
want to keep us separated; no, no! But they <i>do</i> want
to keep us despised!”</p>

<p>In <i>The Grandissimes</i>, a long novel of old Louisiana,
we have the background of slavery well worked in,
and in the foreground, individualized Negro characters,
far more convincing than the abolitionist victims.
Outstanding is Honoré Grandissime, “free
man of color,” educated, successful in business but an
ineffectual victim of caste. Though true to New
Orleans history, his type has been neglected in fiction
for the more fascinating octoroon heroine. Palmyre
is one of the best characterized octoroons in
fiction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This woman had stood all her life with dagger drawn, on the
defensive against what certainly was to her an unmerciful world....
And yet by inexorable decree, she belonged to what we used
to call “the happiest people under the sun.” We ought to stop
saying that.</p>
</div>

<p>Under domineering and insult, Palmyre is shown as
silent; “and so,” says Cable, “sometimes is fire in
the wall.” Clemence, illiterate and superstitious, has
folk-shrewdness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You mus’n b’lieve all dis-yeh nonsense ’bout insurrectionin’; all
fool-nigga talk. W’at we want to be insurrectionin’ faw? We
de happiest people in de God’s worl’! Yes, we is; you jis oughteh
gimme fawty an’ lemme go! Please gen’lemen!</p>
</div>

<p>Her cunning does not help, however, in this drastic
case; she is told to run, and is coolly shot, stone dead.</p>

<p>One of the most unusual figures is the gigantic Bras
Coupé, captured king of the Jaloffs, a legendary figure
with counterpart in Louisiana history. He is contemptuous
of whites, and kills the Negro driver who
first tells him to work. Driven to the swamps for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
striking down his master, he puts a curse on the plantation.
When he is captured he is “hamstrung”, in
accordance with the <i>Code Noir</i>. When the name of
his worst enemy falls upon his ears, even though dying,
he spits upon the floor; when he is begged to forgive,
he merely smiles. “God keep thy enemy from such a
smile”, says the author.</p>

<p>Cable’s fiction shows full acquaintance with folk-songs,
speech, lore and superstition, but unlike his
contemporaries, Page and Harris, he does not use
the material to support old traditions. He makes
clear-eyed, telling observations on the South. A blow,
punishable in a white offender by a small fine or conviction,
assured Bras Coupé the death of a felon, by
the old Code Noir.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(We have a Code Noir now, but the new one is a mental reservation,
not an enactment).... The guests stood for an instant as
if frozen, smitten stiff with the expectation of insurrection, conflagration
and rapine (just as we do today whenever some poor
swaggering Pompey rolls up his fist and gets a ball through his
body)....</p>
</div>

<p>“It seems to be one of the self-punitive characteristics
of tyranny, whether the tyrant be a man, a community,
or a caste, to have a pusillanimous fear of its victims.”
But Cable does not over-idealize the Negro. He is
sharp toward the mulatto caste—“the saddest slaves
of all.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your men, for a little property, and your women, for a little
amorous attention let themselves be shorn even of the virtue of
discontent.... I would rather be a runaway in the swamp than
content myself with such a freedom.</p>
</div>

<p>Although Cable helped to establish the tragic mulatto
stereotypes, his portraits of this caste are drawn from
a specific situation in the past, more pronounced in
New Orleans though widespread in the South. The
stereotype has fascinated later writers who have fallen
under Cable’s charm. But they are without his
information and sympathy, and are therefore less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
truthful. All in all, Cable is one of the finest creators
of Negro character in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><i>Twain.</i> Like Cable, Twain was of southern birth
and upbringing, and fought in the Confederate army
(but for a short time only, in a spirit of horseplay,
learning only how to retreat). The two men lectured
together. Both had sympathies for the underdog and
both attacked the sham chivalry of the South. Mark
Twain insisted that he was almost completely without
race prejudice and that the color brown was “the most
beautiful and satisfying of all the complexions vouchsafed
to man.” He loved the spirituals best among
music. In his youth he grew up with slave boys as
playmates; in his manhood he paid a Negro student’s
way through Yale, as “part of the reparation due
from every white to every black man.”</p>

<p>Twain’s first treatment of Negroes in <i>The Gilded
Age</i> (1873), however, is largely traditional, unlike
“A True Story (Repeated Word For Word As I
Heard It)” which is a bitter memory of cruelty and
separation, contradicting Thomas Nelson Page’s formula
stories.</p>

<p>In <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> (1884) the callousness of the
South to the Negro is indicated briefly, without preaching,
but impellingly. Huck informs Aunt Sally that
a steamboat blew out a cylinder head:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”</p>

<p>“No’m. Killed a nigger.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky because sometimes people do get hurt....”</p>
</div>

<p>In this book Twain deepens the characterization of
Jim, who, like Tom and Huck and the rest of that
fine company, was drawn from life. He is no longer
the simple-minded, mysterious guide in the ways of
dead cats, doodle-bugs and signs of <i>The Adventures of
Tom Sawyer</i>. Running away from old Miss Watson,
who, though religious, “pecks on” him all the time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
treats him “pooty rough” and wants a trader’s eight
hundred dollars for him, Jim joins Huck on the immortal
journey down the Mississippi. His talks enlivens
the voyage. He is at his comic best in detailing his
experience with high finance—he once owned fourteen
dollars. But the fun is brought up sharp by Jim’s</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yes, en I’s rich now, come to look at it. I owns myself en
I’s wuth eight hund’d dollars. I wisht I had de money, I
wouldn’t want no mo’.</p>
</div>

<p>But he did want more. He wanted to get to a free
state and work and save money so he could buy his
wife, and then they would both work to buy their
children, or get an abolitionist to go steal them. Huck
is “frozen at such thoughts;” torn between what he
had been taught was moral and his friendliness for
an underdog. Jim is the best example in nineteenth
century fiction of the average Negro slave (not the
tragic mulatto or the noble savage), illiterate, superstitious,
yet clinging to his hope for freedom, to his
love for his own. And he is completely believable,
whether arguing that Frenchman should talk like
people, or doing most of the work on the raft, or forgiving
Huck whose trick caused him to be bitten by
a snake, or sympathizing with the poor little Dauphin,
who, since America has no kings, “cain’t git no situation.”
He tells of his little daughter, whom he had
struck, not knowing she disobeyed because she had
become deaf from scarlet fever:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... En all uv a sudden I says pow! jis’ as loud as I could yell.
She never budge! Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin’ en grab her up
in my arms, en say, “Oh, de po’ little thing! De Lord God
Almighty forgive po’ ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to forgive
hisself as long’s he live!” Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb,
Huck, plum deef en dumb—en I’d been a-treatin’ her so!</p>
</div>

<p>From the great tenderness and truth of this portrait
<i>Pudd’nhead Wilson</i> (1894), Twain’s last novel
concerning Negroes, falls a great way. In violent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
ugly Dawson’s Landing a fantastic tale is set. Roxana,
only one-sixteenth Negro, a handsome earthy Amazon,
is the mother of a son, Valet de Chambre, fathered
by a gentleman of the F.F.V’s. This baby was born
on the same day as her master’s son, Thomas à Becket
Driscoll, and looks exactly like him. In order to save
the baby from slavery, Roxy exchanges the two. The
boys grow up with their positions reversed; the false
Valet is ruined by slavery, and Tom, ruined by pampering,
becomes a liar, coward, gambler, thief and
murderer. In desperate straits, he tricks his mother
and sells her down the river. Although Tom’s character
could be attributed to a rigid caste system that
granted excessive power to petty people, Twain leaves
many readers believing that he agrees with Roxy who,
astounded by her son’s worthlessness, muttered: “Ain’t
nigger enough in him to show in his finger-nails, en
dat takes mighty little, yit dey’s enough to paint his
soul.” Twain has little good to say for slavery in
this book. Roxy’s terror of being sold “down the
river,” and her experiences there under a vicious Yankee
overseer are grimly realistic. Roxy is a first-rate
preliminary sketch. By no means faultless, a petty
thief and a liar, she is capable of sacrifice, and has
intelligence, pride, and courage. If Twain had spent
more time in developing her portrait, <i>Pudd’nhead Wilson</i>
would have been a better novel.</p>

<p><i>Humorists.</i> One of those humorists whose misspellings
and satiric temper pleased Abraham Lincoln,
Petroleum V. Nasby (David Ross Locke), wrote
<i>Nasby: Divers Views, Opinions and Prophecies</i>
(1866) and <i>Ekkoes From Kentucky</i> (1868), both
showing post-war attitudes to the Negro. Pretending
to be a Copperhead postmaster, Nasby reveals himself
as an ignorant, besotted politician, forever dragging
in the race question for personal gain. Some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Nasby’s shafts could well be used at southern rabble-rousers
today. Nasby shows how the cry of Negro
domination and amalagmation rose whenever the
slightest effort was made for justice to the freedmen.
Severely satirical of southern chivalry, Nasby shows
the white daughters of John Guttle, a gentleman of
Mobile, fighting against their Negro half-sisters over
their father’s tomb, and concludes that “there wuz
some disadvantages attending the patriarkle system.”
To those who saw the Negro as unfit for freedom he
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three hundred niggers ... wuz wrencht from paternal care
to starve, which the most uv ’em are industriously doin’ at
about $3 per day.</p>
</div>

<p>He advises the legislatures to forbid Negroes to leave
their country, and then to pass laws setting up a
maximum wage for Negroes of five dollars a month.
Thousands of Negroes will then die by midwinter and
the rest will beg to be reenslaved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We kin ... pint 2 their bodies and say in a sepulkered tone:
‘Wen niggers wuz wuth $1500, they wuz not allowed to die thus—behold
the froots uv Ablishun philanthropy.’</p>
</div>

<p>For all of his burlesque, Nasby saw clearly and
prophesied sanely. A whole school of southern writers
came along and did in dead earnest what he had counselled
in bitter jest.</p>

<p><i>Samantha On The Race Problem</i> by Marietta Holley
counsels colonization even so late as 1892, recounts
the tragedies of a few superior mulattoes, and most
important, shows the Florida Ku Klux Klan at its
work of burning schools and terrorizing Negroes who
were forging ahead.</p>

<p><i>Northern Novelists.</i> John William DeForest’s
realistic novels of the South immediately after the
Civil War, <i>Miss Ravenal’s Conversion From Secession</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
<i>to Loyalty</i> (1867) and <i>Kate Beaumont</i> (1872), contain
minor Negro characters, but these are generally
typical. In 1867, Rebecca Harding Davis wrote the
dramatic, sympathetic <i>Waiting For The Verdict</i>, the
first novel to deal with the dilemma of the fair Negro
who attains a superior position without being suspected
of having Negro blood. Constance Fenimore Woolson’s
short stories of the South, written in the eighties,
have been praised for their sane balance. In “Rodman
The Keeper” she describes with sympathy the
freedmen—bent, dull-eyed and ignorant, singing
“Swing Low Sweet Chariot” on their way to the
graves of Federal Soldiers “who had done something
wonderful for them and their children.” Generally,
however, Miss Woolson is irritated by the freedmen,
reserving her liking for those who are traditionally
loyal to their white-folks, and seeing little in “the
glories of freedom” except the “freedom to die.”
“King David” shows a Northern educator who gives
up in the face of “universal, irresponsible ignorance.”
Miss Woolson recognizes the shiftlessness and chauvinism
of the planter class, but keeps her sharpness
for the “misguided and untimely idealism” of northerners.
She tries so hard to be just to the fallen ex-planter
that she is less than just to the rising ex-slaves. In
these grievous times, the second stood in the greater
need of justice.</p>

<p><i>Tourgée.</i> Albion Tourgée differed from Miss
Woolson sharply in his discoveries. He had a good
chance for observation. He was an officer in the
Union Army, and after the war remained in North
Carolina as a judge. If he is a typical example of a
carpetbagger, then his class has met with grave underestimation.
He was thoughtful, considerate, courageous
and honest. Like Miss Woolson, he recognized
the gravity of the problem facing the South. Unlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
her, however, he did not believe that the problem
existed only because the freedmen were irresponsible,
ignorant and unready for citizenship. He had seen
too often what she omitted from her picture: the mob
violence of the Regulators and the Ku Klux Klan, the
determination to restore slavery, the ostracism of the
“misguided” school teachers, the burning of the
schools. He was a humane man, and he could not
hold his peace. But he spoke on the unpopular side,
and today he is barely mentioned in histories of American
literature.</p>

<p><i>A Fool’s Errand</i>, by “One of the Fools” (1879),
is largely autobiographical, and has been called “The
Uncle Tom’s Cabin of Reconstruction.” Colonel
Servosse, an officer of the Federal Army, took up residence
in the South, foolishly believing that, with the
end of the war, the North-South hostility would end.
He soon learns better; for lending aid to Negroes in
need he is called a “nigger lover,” for making a speech
urging justice to Negroes he barely escapes being
horsewhipped. Yankee schoolmarms are insulted.
When northern troops are withdrawn, terrorization
of Negroes quickly follows. A Union League organizer
is killed by the Klan, which is composed of prominent
southerners. Negroes are shown hard at work,
struggling to make their living, enthusiastically welcoming
schools, lurking about the edges of crowds at
political meetings, listening intently to the speeches,
or organizing for protection. In a section hotly intent
that there shall be no “nigger witnesses, no nigger
juries, no nigger voters,” all of this is insolence and
insult.</p>

<p>Jerry is the type of uncle not before met with in
American fiction. He is religious and devoted to Servosse,
not out of loyalty of slave to master, but out of
gratitude that Servosse was helping his people to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
true freedom. Jerry has his dignity; when whites
ridicule his church services he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An’ when you all laughs at us, we can’t help tinkin’ dat we
mout a done better ef we hadn’t been kep’ slaves all our lives by
you uns.</p>
</div>

<p>But in one of his sermons, he tells too much about the
Klan’s most recent murder, and he is swung from a
tree to prove that “It don’t do fer niggers to know
too much.” Another different Negro is the blacksmith,
Bob Martin, who makes such a good living
that he becomes a marked man for the night riders.
He scornfully ridicules the superstition that the Klan
is ghostly, showing his scarred back as proof of the
Klan’s “humanity.” He tells a shocking story of his
own beating, the abuse of his wife and daughter, the
death of his baby, and the destroying of his home,
all supposed to teach him to be more respectful of
white folks and less anxious to vote for radicals. Bob
is of the stuff of heroes, however; he was in the Union
Army at Fort Wagner, and he doggedly swears that
“ef dere’s any mo’ Kluckers raidin’ roun’ Burke’s Corner,
dar’ll be some funerals too.” Later editions of
<i>A Fool’s Errand</i> included documentary evidence of
the sinister workings of the Klan, a key to the truth
something like the <i>Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>.</p>

<p>The title <i>A Fool’s Errand</i> lays blame only on the
folly of rash hopes for improvement in the South, not
on the effort to get justice. <i>Bricks Without Straw</i>
(1880) is a more developed attempt to show the
desperate problem, to prove that without support from
the rest of the country, those few who were struggling
were “making bricks without straw.” Nimbus,
the outstanding Negro character, is uneducated, but
he fought in the Civil War, and is a man of courage
and good, hard sense. Industrious and thrifty, he is
disliked by the whites because he has a good house, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
tobacco barn, a fine crop and valuable stock, and a
church and schoolhouse on his place. He adds to
these injuries the insult of wanting pay for his wife’s
services, and schools and the vote for all of his people.
When the Klansmen, among whom are many aristocrats—“the
freedmen’s best friends”—come after him,
Nimbus, aided by his wife Lugena, who fights with an
axe, resists fiercely, and finally gets away. Returning
years later, broken in health but not in spirit after
experiencing riots, peonage and prison camps, Nimbus
will not stay, but leads an exodus to Kansas. Elijah
Hill, the schoolteacher, and Berry Lawson, good-natured
avoider of trouble, but wily and loyal to
Nimbus, are interesting minor figures.</p>

<p>Tourgée’s other books on the Negro are not so valuable
as these. <i>A Royal Gentleman</i> (1881), written
earlier as <i>Toinette</i>, is pretentious, with a crowded plot.
Mabel, mother of Toinette, is crazed by her unhappy
life as the mistress of a white slave owner, and tries
to murder those who would inflict upon her daughter
the same fate. But Toinette, a refined olive-skinned
beauty, is in love with, and beloved by her owner.
Since he is a “royal gentleman,” marriage cannot take
place, and tragedy follows. The characters are idealized,
and the incidents far-fetched. <i>Hot Plowshares</i>
(1883) is a historical novel on the state of the nation
preceding the Civil War. Great attention is paid to the
rise of antislavery sentiment and the Underground
Railroad. <i>Pactolus Prime</i> (1890) shows the economic
hardships faced by Negroes in Washington, D. C.
Pactolus is the father of a girl whom he disclaims in
order that she may live as white, may be lifted “from
shame to honor.” Upon her discovery of the real
truth, she takes the vows as Sister Pactola, and dedicates
her life to her race. The story is not completely
convincing, but Tourgee again reveals himself as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
conversant with problems faced by Negroes. These
novels have more argument than characters in action,
but the argument is what has been too easily forgotten
today.</p>

<p><i>Hearn.</i> To Lafcadio Hearn the southern novel
was “gushy-floriated English—written in bad taste,
wishy-washy trash.” With his sympathy for the underdog,
strengthened by his connection with the quadroon
Althea Foley, he admired Cable’s defense of the
Negro. Nevertheless, Hearn did not censure the
South openly. He held stock beliefs such as that the
Negro would disappear in freedom—“dependent like
the ivy, he needs some strong oak-like friend to cling
to”—and that it was only the mulatto influence that
made slaves unmanageable. Always attracted by the
unusual and picturesque, Hearn became an authority
on Louisiana lore, making friends with the <i>bonnes
vielles negresses</i>, who sold homemade sweetmeats in
New Orleans, and the mysterious Voodoo Queen,
Marie Laveau. But the teeming levees come to life
only in sketches like “Dolly, an Idyl of the Levee”
and “Banjo Jim’s Story” (1876). In the West Indies
Hearn was struck by the “appetizing golden bodies
of the Martinique Quadroons, sensuous but childlike,”
gossiped with the washerwomen and treasured their
soft slurring talk; and watched</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the <i>porteuses</i> on their way to market in the early morning, huge
baskets of fruit and vegetables balanced on their heads, their
skirts tucked into a belt in front, showing the shapely muscled
bronze of their legs, as they walked with all the lithe feline grace
of some wild animal.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Youma</i>, “La Giablesse” and “Un Ravenant” are good
fiction of the West Indies, but the wealth of Hearn’s
sensitive observation appears in his travel reporting.
He was better in describing settings than in presenting
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p><i>Howells.</i> The serious phase of Negro life that
William Dean Howells thought worthy of inclusion
in his canvas of the American scene was the age-worn
tragedy of the octoroon. In <i>An Imperative Duty</i>
(1892), Rhoda, the beautiful daughter of a northern
physician and an accomplished octoroon, bore no evidence
of Negro blood. On the eve of her marriage,
she is told her lineage by her duty-bound aunt. Later,
passing for an Italian and happily married to a man
who is undisturbed by her lineage, she is still wretched
at her “disgrace.” The novel is sympathetic, but
there were graver, less romantic problems of Negro
life that a novelist of Howells’ scope and ability might
have presented.</p>

<p><i>Negro Novelists.</i> Two Negro authors who had
given their best energies to the antislavery struggle
turned to fiction in the post-Civil War years. William
Wells Brown’s <i>My Southern Home</i> (1880) included
sketches of southern Negro folklife, before the successes
of Page and Harris. Frances Harper, whose
antislavery poetry was popular, now defended her
race in <i>Iola Leroy</i> or <i>Shadows Uplifted</i> (1892). Iola,
granddaughter of a Creole planter, has the experiences
usual to fiction of the beautiful “white slave.”
She is kept ignorant of her race, and educated in the
North. When her white father’s marriage to her
quadroon mother is called illegal, she is sold as a
slave. After indignities in slavery, she is rescued, and
serves as a nurse in a Civil War hospital. She rejects
the love of a white New England physician, who,
though knowing her race, wishes to marry her. With
her brothers and long-lost uncle, all of whom refuse
to “pass for white,” she dedicates herself to her
people. The book is “uplifting” but is far from convincing
in incident, speech, and characterization. Iola
is another of the octoroon heroines too angelic for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
acceptance. Some of the minor characters are better,
but they cannot redeem the novel.</p>

<p><i>Dunbar.</i> Dunbar has aptly described the typical
setting for his fiction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Happy Hollow.... Wherever Negroes colonize in the cities or
villages, North or South, wherever the hod-carrier, the porter,
and the waiter are the society men of the town; wherever the
picnic and the excursion are the chief summer diversion, and the
revival the winter-time of repentance.... Wherever laughter
and tears rub elbows by day, and the spirit of labour and laziness
shake hands, there—there—is Happy Hollow.</p>
</div>

<p><i>In Old Plantation Days</i> (1903) repeats the Thomas
Nelson Page formula. Negro house servants comically
ape the “quality,” or intervene in lovers’ quarrels,
or in duels between cavaliers. One slave deceives his
beloved master into believing that the good times of
slavery still prevail. The planters, highbred and
chivalrous, and the slaves, childish and devoted, rival
each other in affection and sacrifice. These anecdotes
of slavery, but a step above minstrel jokes, are all too
happy for words, and too happy for truth.</p>

<p>The harshness of Reconstruction and of Dunbar’s
own time is likewise conventionally neglected in his
other volumes of short stories: <i>Folks From Dixie</i>
(1898), <i>The Strength of Gideon</i> (1900), and <i>The
Heart of Happy Hollow</i> (1904). Freedmen discover
that after all their best friends are their kindly
ex-masters. In “Nels Hatton’s Revenge,” an upstanding
Negro gives his hard-earned money and best
clothes to his destitute master, who had abused him
when a slave. The venality of Reconstruction politicians,
which certainly existed, is satirized; but the gains
of Reconstruction, which certainly exist, are understressed.
Probably with due cause, Dunbar feared the
rising poor-whites; therefore, like many Negro
spokesmen of the period, he idealized the ex-planter
class, the “aristocrats,” <i>without</i> due cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Dunbar’s fiction veers away from anything more
serious than laughter or gentle tears. “At Shaft 11”
shows the difficulties of Negro strikebreakers; but,
afraid of organized labor, Dunbar idealized owners,
operators, and staunchly loyal Negro workers who get
to be foremen, thus carrying over the plantation tradition
formula into the industrial scene. “The Ordeal
at Mt. Hope” faces the loose-living of a “Happy
Hollow,” and then is lost in sentimental compromise.
Dunbar wrote two stories of lynching, “The Lynching
of Jule Benson” and the unusually ironic “The
Tragedy at Three Corners.” But Dunbar usually
places the hardships of Negro life in the city, as in
“Jimsella,” with pastoral distrust of the city and faith
in rural virtue. Fast livers, quacks, politicians and
hypocritical race leaders are occasionally attacked.</p>

<p><i>The Sport of the Gods</i> (1902), Dunbar’s most
ambitious novel, is the only one that is chiefly about
Negroes. The first of the book is trite, but the latter
section, though confused and melodramatic, has a
grimness that Dunbar seldom showed. Berry, the
innocent victim of a degenerate white man’s crime in
the South, and his family, the victim of hostile New
York, are treated somewhat in the manner of Hardy’s
tragic laughing-stocks. The book has serious weaknesses,
but it gives promise that Dunbar, but for his
untimely death, might have become a prose writer of
power. Judged by his accomplishment, however, Dunbar
in fiction must be considered as one who followed
the leader, not as a blazer of new trails.</p>

<p><i>Chesnutt.</i> Charles Waddell Chesnutt, however,
deserves to be called a pioneer. Writing to counter
charges such as those made by Page in <i>Red Rock</i>,
Chesnutt is the first to speak out uncompromisingly,
but artistically, on the problems facing his people. One
careful critic has stated that Chesnutt “was the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Negro novelist, and he is still the best,” and another
has said that his books contain early drafts of about
all of the recent Negro novels.</p>

<p>In Chesnutt’s <i>The Conjure Woman</i>, seven tales
based upon Negro superstitions, Uncle Julius recalls
Uncle Remus and Page’s Uncle Billy, but differs from
them in his craftiness. He tells his stories not merely
to entertain, or to bewail the beautiful past, toward
which he is ironic, but to gain his point in the present.
His dialect is worked out in great detail, but is not so
readable as that of Uncle Remus. There is good
local color throughout, and some interesting characters
emerge.</p>

<p><i>The Wife of His Youth, and Other Stories of the
Color Line</i> (1899) deals mainly with problems of
race. The title story tells of a successful Negro in
Groveland (Cleveland), the “dean” of the “Blue-Veins,”
who, on the eve of his engagement to a beautiful
widow, theatrically acknowledges a little old black
woman who had been his wife in slavery days and had
helped him to freedom. A Negro mother denies her
octoroon daughter in order for her to marry a New
Englander of Mayflower lineage in “Her Virginia
Mammy,” a story like Cable’s “Madame Delphine”
but less convincing and gripping. In “The Sheriff’s
Children” a mulatto prisoner, falsely accused of
murder, is defended from a mob by a sheriff who
turns out to be his father. Desperate and cynical, the
son is about to kill his father to escape when he is
shot by the sheriff’s daughter. In “The Web of Circumstance”
a Negro blacksmith, falsely accused of
stealing a whip, is sentenced to five years in the penitentiary
on the same day that a white murderer is
sentenced to one year. “The Passing of Grandison”
shows a cunning slave, pretending to despise the abolitionist
North, returning to his “understanding” master.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
He does so, however, only to manage the escape of all
his kith and kin. “A Matter of Principle” satirizes the
color line within the race: Clayton, an uppercrust
near-white Negro, who “declined to associate with
black people,” pretends that his house is quarantined
in order to keep a black Congressman from calling
on his daughter. The Congressman turns out to be a
mulatto, “well worthy” of Clayton’s daughter.</p>

<p><i>The House Behind the Cedars</i> (1900), Chesnutt’s
first novel, is concerned likewise with the color line.
Rena, another octoroon heroine, is insulted by whites
and oppressed by her mother and a mulatto suitor.
Honorable devotion comes to her only through an
upstanding black hero, but this cannot forestall her
pathetic death. <i>The Marrow of Tradition</i> (1901),
less conventional, is better. White characters range
from the aristocratic General Delamere to his
debauched grandson Tom; Major Carteret, demagogue
for white supremacy; and McBane, ex-slave
driver who knows one solution: “Burn the nigger.”
Negro characters range from Dr. Miller, a skillful
physician, to the militant Josh Green; the loyal Sandy,
and Jerry, a “white man’s nigger.” Sandy is framed
for a murder in the first part of the book. A bloody
riot, based on the one at Wilmington, N. C., is
described in the second part. The white demagogues
whip up the mob to fury, because a Negro newspaper
has denounced lynching. Josh Green, who is willing
to die rather than be shot down like a dog, who puts
aside “fergetfulness and fergiveness,” leads the
aroused Negroes, when the upper-class Negroes
believe that nothing can be done. The novel closes,
however, on a note of forgetting and forgiving: Dr.
Miller, whose own child was killed in the riot, goes
to the home of his wife’s white half-sister, to save
her child with his very great medical skill. With all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
of its melodrama, the story has power; badly plotted,
it still tells a great deal about social life in the South.
Chesnutt idealizes some Negro characters, but candidly
faces the weaknesses in others. Most important,
however, is his going beneath the surface to social
causes.</p>

<p>Chesnutt’s last novel was <i>The Colonel’s Dream</i>.
Colonel French, an ex-Confederate officer of “family,”
dreams of resurrecting his native section and bringing
it into the ways of prosperity and justice. As in so
many novels of the time, his dream is not realized.
He has opposed to him William Fetters, convict labor
contractor, mortgage shark and political boss, together
with the reactionary traditions and the inertia of the
South. When the casket of his aged Negro slave, who
had given his life for the Colonel’s son, is dug up
from the family burial plot and placed on his porch
with a K.K.K. warning that the color line must continue
even in death, he sees that his crusade is doomed.
After this novel Chesnutt fell into an almost unbroken
silence. Perhaps he felt the doom of his own crusade
to bring about justice.</p>

<p>Whether he was pessimistic about his crusade or
not, his achievements in fiction were worthy. Answering
propaganda with propaganda, he might be
expected to have certain faults. He was overinclined to
the melodramatic, to mistaken identity, to the lost
document turning up at the right or wrong moment,
to the nick of time entrance. His characters are generally
idealized or conventional. His “better class
Negroes” speak too literary a language and are generally
unbelievable models in behavior. Although
attacking the color line within the race, he makes great
use of the hero or heroine of mixed blood, and at
times seems to accept the traditional concepts of Negro
character. Even so, however, his characters stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
nearer to the truth than those of Thomas Page or
Thomas Dixon; he does not force them into only two
grooves. There is no gainsaying his knowledge of the
southern scene, or of the Negro upper class in northern
cities. Unlike Dunbar he is opposed to the plantation
tradition, sharply critical of southern injustice,
and aware of the sinister forces at work in Reconstruction.
Deploring the abuses of that era, he still sees,
like Tourgée, that the story of a South victimized by
carpet-baggers and scalawags is only a convenient half-truth.
He gives high praise to the Yankee schoolmasters
and schoolmarms who swarmed over Dixie to lift
a second bondage from the freedmen. He shows
exploitation, riots and lynching mobs, as well as the
more refined exercising of prejudice. Often pompous
and roundabout, in the manner of his times, he nevertheless
knew how to hold a reader’s interest. We must
concede that he was melodramatic in plotting, but evidences
of a skillful master’s hand can still be found.
He knew a great deal, and all things considered, he told
it well.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> Deriving somewhat from the abolitionists,
the best of the authors of this chapter attacked
the plantation tradition, but with the sharper weapons
of the growing realism. Twain’s Jim and Roxana,
Tourgée’s Nimbus, Chesnutt’s Josh Green, and even
Cable’s Bras Coupé and Madame Delphine (though
they belong to a nearly legendary past) are far more
convincing than Uncle Tom, Topsy and Hildreth’s
Archy Moore. Unlike their more popular contemporaries
who defended the plantation tradition, these
authors, at a risk, recorded the injustice that Negroes
met with everywhere in “the tragic era.” They knew
that worshipful house-servants or depraved freedmen
were not the sole actors in the story, and as lovers of
truth and justice they wanted the full story told.</p>

<p class="c p2">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</p>

<p>1. Why was Cable considered untrue to the Old
South?</p>

<p>2. In what respects is Bras Coupe unusual in fiction
about Negroes?</p>

<p>3. Compare the octoroons in antislavery novels
with those in novels by Cable, Twain, and Tourgée.</p>

<p>4. Since Twain characterizes Jim as superstitious
and illiterate, how can Twain be considered sympathetic?</p>

<p>5. Why are Hearn’s beliefs about Negroes termed
“stock”?</p>

<p>6. Compare William Wells Brown’s <i>Clotel</i> with
Frances Harper’s <i>Iola Leroy</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c6">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">OLD PATHS</p>


<p><i>Beautiful, Amusing Servitude.</i> In the early twentieth
century, under the influence of Thomas Nelson
Page, a legion of writers wept over the vanished
glory of the old plantation and presented Negroes of
extreme devotedness to their masters. One writer
in her book of sketches grieved:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aunt Phebe, Uncle Tom, Black Mammy, Uncle Gus, Aunt
Jonas, Uncle Isom, and all the rest—who shall speak all your
virtues or enshrine your simple faith and fidelity? It is as impossible
as it is to describe the affection showered upon you by
those whom you called ‘Marster and Missis.’</p>
</div>

<p>Impossible though it may have been, countless authors
attempted it, turning back time in its flight to sweetness
and splendor that belong to another world than
this.</p>

<p>Of the short stories in abundance that idealized
the Negro, <i>in his place</i>, a few examples must serve.
Betty Reynolds Cobb, in “The Coward” shows little
Nemi conquering his great fears, and facing a raging
torrent in order to get a doctor for “li’l Missy.” (Cf.
Kate Chopin’s “Beyond The Bayou.”) In Will Harben’s
“The Sale of Uncle Rastus”, a nearly dead slave
shams perfect health in order to fetch a better price
for his bankrupt owner. His heroism reconciles his
beloved master to an estranged brother, who bids two
thousand dollars for him. “Dem boys done made
up, en I fotch two thousand dollars! Whooee!”
croaks Uncle Rastus at death’s door. “Abram’s Freedom,”
by Edna Turpin, shows Emmaline, who has
struggled to buy her husband’s freedom, saying: “Me
an’ Abram ain’t got nothin’ to do in dis worl’ but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
wait on you an’ master.” These are merely duplicates
of stories by more talented Reconstruction
authors, with names and settings changed. Their
authors have little to say, but say it over and over.</p>

<p>Ruth McEnery Stuart rises a notch above these.
Although she glorified the past in <i>The River’s Children</i>
(1903) most of her work was local color of the
deep South. In such works as <i>Napoleon Jackson</i>
(1902), <i>George Washington Jones</i> (1903) and <i>The
Second Wooing of Salina Sue</i> (1905), Negro life in
the picturesquely shabby towns is quaint and droll,
an unending source of mirth and satisfaction for the
white-folks. Napoleon Jackson, the gentleman of
the plush rocker, whose mother swore that he should
never lay hand to a plow, worships old Marse and is
therefore charming in Mrs. Stuart’s sight. His wife
Rose Ann, a visionary, is astonished that people pity
Negroes since “we see mo’n white folks sees.” Marital
difficulties and burlesques of Negro church services
furnish much of the drollery. Salina Sue, forced
to marry her common-law husband, speaks of her
fifteen-year old daughter: “Hit’ll be a mighty good
an’ ’ligious thing for her to remember in after-years.
Tain’t every yo’ng gal dat kin ricollec’ her pa an’
ma gittin’ married.”</p>

<p>Better known writers preserving the tradition
include the gifted Sarah Orne Jewett, whose <i>The Mistress
of Sydenham Plantation</i> is like Constance Woolson’s
<i>East Angels</i> in showing a northern woman’s
respect for a servant’s loyalty; Frank Stockton, who
turned his facile invention to the Negro in <i>The Cloverfield’s
Carriage</i> and <i>The Late Mrs. Null</i>; and
Booth Tarkington who invests the old picture with
charm in <i>Penrod and Sam</i>. All of these are superior
writers to such southern writers as Mrs. Burton Harrison,
Opie Read and Marion Harland, but they give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
no new interpretation. Some authors, like Virginia
Frasel Boyle in <i>Devil Tales</i> (1900), followed Harris
into the fertile field (and the wilderness) of folklore.
Ed Mott’s <i>The Black Homer of Jim Town</i> (1900)
is a collection of folk tales from the Cape Fear country
of North Carolina. Most of them are trite. Slavery
is remembered as a good time, and in one of the tallest
of the tales, a Negro in the Federal army arrives at
the battle just in time to intercept a bullet intended
for his Confederate master, in whose arms he dies.</p>

<p>Women writers of the South have been particularly
attracted to literary exercises about the legendary
chivalry, the perfect masters and slaves. In
their prefaces, they seem to consider it their duty to
“interpret the Negro race” and to lecture upon the
modern Negro’s deficiencies. Among these might
be mentioned Emma Speed Sampson for <i>Mammy’s
White Folks</i> (1919) and <i>Miss Minerva On The Old
Plantation</i> (1923); Jane Baldwin Cotton for <i>Wall-Eyed
Caesar’s Ghost</i> (1925) and Virginia McCormick
for <i>Charcoal and Chalk</i> (1931). Pity for “the
child who never had a fat, brown mammy with elastic
lap and warm enfolding arms,” alternates with beaming
appreciation of happy-hearted pickaninnies living
an endless picnic. “A real understanding of our
colored people” generally amounts to having great
fun out of them. The dialect is often carefully
recorded, but the Negroes say about the same things
that Page had them say long ago, to flatter their white-folks
and to make them laugh.</p>

<p>Although willing to poke gentle fun at his native
South, O. Henry kept to its old tradition about Negro
character. Uncle Bushrod in “The Guardian of The
Accolade”, remembering Miss Lucy’s words for Marse
Robert: “a little child but my knight, pure and fearless
and widout reproach,” prevents Robert from absconding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
with what he thinks to be the cash of the bank,
but what turns out to be two quarts of old silk velvet
Bourbon. “The Fourth in Salvador” has a</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>buck coon from Georgia who had drifted down there from a
busted-up colored colony that had been started on some possumless
land in Mexico. As soon as he heard us say barbecue he
wept for joy and groveled on the ground.</p>
</div>

<p>“The Emancipation of Billy” has an ancient body-servant,
Old Jeff, a member of “de fambly,” who
despises “Yankee rascality enduring’ the war,” speaking
“de fambly’s” language <i>to a T</i>. “A Municipal
Report” shows a faithful Negro coachman, Uncle
Caesar, who supports his impoverished mistress, and
kills her worthless husband (a professional southerner)
for robbing her. A master of surprises, O.
Henry has no surprises for us when he handles Negro
characters. They belong to an endless line.</p>

<p><i>Irvin Cobb and The Professional Humorists.</i> Irvin
Cobb, whom some consider heir to the roving shoes
of O. Henry, once had a favorite character declaim:
“I ain’t no problem, I’se a pusson. I craves to be so
reguarded.” But when Cobb regards Jeff Poindexter,
he sees little more than a loyal and ridiculous servant,
who says the right things. Jeff advises a white moving
picture producer as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ef you kin git hold of a crowd of cullid actors w’ich is willin’
to ack lak the sho’nuff ole time cullid an’ not lak onbleached imitations
of w’ite folks, it seems lak to me the rest of it oughter be
plum easy. Mostly I’d mek the pitchers comical, ef I wuz you.
You kin do ’at an’ still not hurt nobody’s feelin’s, w’ite nur black.
Ef you wants to perduse a piece showin’ a lot of niggers
gittin’ skinned, let it be another nigger w’ich skins em....
Then, w’en at the last, they gits even wid him it’ll still be nigger
ag’inst nigger. An’ ef, oncet in awhile, you meks a kind of serious
pitcher ... ’at ought to fetch there yere new-issue cullid
folks w’ich is seemingly become so plentiful up Nawth. But
mainly I’d stick to the laffin’ line ef I wuz you. An’ whatever
else you does, don’t mess wid no race problem.</p>
</div>

<p>Irvin Cobb takes Jeff’s advice, fondly affectionate
toward the “old time cullid,” derisive of the new-issue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
“onbleached imitations of w’ite folks,” unwilling
to hurt the feelings of any of his large white audience.
As a result, his books such as <i>J. Poindexter, Colored</i>
and those about Old Judge Priest rise little above
the joke-book level when dealing with Negroes, in
spite of Cobb’s undoubted knowledge of his native
Kentucky. McBlair’s <i>Mister Fish Kelly</i> (1924) is
similarly traditional, with some surface truth to comic
elements in Negro life, but too set upon tickling
America.</p>

<p>But that is a well paying business, as such writers
as Hugh Wiley, Arthur Akers, Octavus Roy Cohen
and E. K. Means have discovered. Belonging to
light entertainment literature, their stories would
hardly deserve serious attention, were it not for their
undoubted social influence. With situations ranging
from the improbable to the unreal, the comedy, the
farce are not “pure,” but are mixed all up with propaganda
for Negro inferiority and subordination. These
authors stem from Page and the Reconstruction:
although they stress the comical, they likewise urge
the mutual affection between funny Negroes and their
fine white-folks, and bear witness to the sunny life
of the South. Guy Johnson has written that there
is a sort of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>folk attitude of the white man toward the Negro.... He must
have his fun out of the Negro, even when writing serious novels
about him.</p>
</div>

<p>How much more fun the professional marketmen of
humor have out of the Negro is apparent when one
reads the stories of Wiley, Akers, and Cohen, to name
only three who write for wide circulation magazines
such as <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and the <i>Red Book</i>.
With the help of the radio, these family magazines
see to it that there is a comic Negro in every middle
class home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Hugh Wiley in the twenties presented Wildcat,
inseparable from Lady Luck, his unsavory goat. Like
O. Henry, Wiley uses outrageous metaphors, but one
does not have to believe the language to be Negro
merely because it is amusing. Pet expressions are such
as “crematized or secluded in de ground” for burial
rites, “paraphernalia of chance” for dice, and other
minstrel joke-book relics. The humor is broad, concerned
with perspiring three-hundred pound black
Amazons, “battling brunettes,” a goat outsmelling
creation, whose butting causes Wildcat to “skid over
the curb in a pose which cost his army pants half of
their seating capacity.” Wildcat is a “champion ration
battler,” barely making it on four meals a day, lazy
except at the irresistible crap game, where he wins
fabulous sums with other-worldly luck. Characters
are named Miss Cuspidora Lee, Vitus Marsden,
Honey Tone, Dwindle Daniels, Punic Hunter, Presidump
Ham Grasty, Festus Roach. There are many
jobs (generally unwelcome) and a great deal of money
and food in circulation; the law is loud-mouthed but
gentle; things are “hotsy-totsy” down in Dixie, Lady
Luck and the whitefolks will see to that. It all
strives very hard, but it could be more amusing.</p>

<p>Of these professionally funny men, Octavus Roy
Cohen is probably most widely known and industrious.
Cohen and his large following are entranced by the
comedy of what Cobb called “onbleached imitations
of white folks.” The idea of Negro doctors, lawyers,
bankers, movie-magnates and society belles in Birmingham
is too funny, but not too funny for words.
Some of his annual books are <i>Assorted Chocolates</i>
(1922), <i>Dark Days and Black Knights</i> (1923), <i>Bigger
and Blacker</i> (1925), <i>Black and Blue</i> (1926) and
<i>Highly Colored</i> (1921). All are highly colored: he
names his characters Orifice Latimer, Callous Deech,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Magnolius Ricketts, Excelsior Nix, Forcep Swain,
Exotic Hines, Unit Smith, Jasper De Vord, Chromo
Bridal and Atlas Brack. His dialect is one unheard
on land or sea: “Got to ain’t has got;” “I ain’t sawn
her right recent;” “Does anybody discover that I
ain’t you, you is suddenly gwine to become ain’t;”
“salisfried, straduced, light bombastic, applicatin, foolisment;
oh, whoa is me!” The plots and counterplots
generally turn around the axis of money or love; the
honest hero defeats the slickers, the boy gets the
girl. Florian Slappey, in Harlem, is fleeced in the
cold winter by two Harlem number men, but the
happy ending is usual. The Sons and Daughters of
I Will Arise, The Enter Paradise In Style Life and
Death Sassiety, and The Over The River Buryin’
Sassiety figure prominently. There seems to be a
great deal of money in Negro Birmingham, but
when Cohen speaks of a Negro star being paid one
hundred dollars a week by a Negro movie company,
he reveals his myth-making powers. One of Cohen’s
recent heroes, Epic Peters, is a pompously talking
Pullman porter, proud of his service to “quality white
folks” whom he can tell at a glance, happy, amusing,
and about as real as his speech: “Goodness, goshness,
Miss Agness, Mr. Foster—I suttinly thought I was
gwine see you become ain’t.”</p>

<p>Arthur K. Akers’ world is less unreal, but equally
droll. Jeff thus explains his connubial woes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hit’s on account of me bein’ weak in de’rithmetic. Dat’s huccome
I cain’t ricollect is I got two weddin’s and three d’voces,
or three weddin’s an’ two d’voces. Emmline come in dar somewhar.</p>
</div>

<p>Akers has a fondness for names like Shakespeare
Shackleford, Columbus Collins, Aspirin Edwards and
Halfportion. His intricate plots invariably end happily
for the dull-witted, inept heroes such as Gladstone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Smith who is “numb from the neck up.” Ipecac
Ignalls, looking like “something dark that had been
left under a tent—an orange-colored tent with LIFE
GUARD lettered across it” does not know how to
swim, but he saves the life of a belle by letting her
stand on him while he is on the bottom of the pool
drowning. Other comedy is furnished by lodge-life
and financial high-jinks performed by the Worthymost
Master Samson Bates and Horace Tombs, who are
Get Rich Quick Wallingfords in blackface.</p>

<p>E. K. Means, whose stories were collected in
volumes called <i>E. K. Means</i>, <i>More E. K. Means</i>, and
<i>Further E. K. Means</i>, insists that he wrote out of a
whimsical fondness for the Negro “to whom God has
given two supreme gifts—Music and Laughter.” He
seems to agree with one of his white characters, however,
that the Negro “has a one-cylinder mind and a
smoky spark-plug.” Nigger-Heel Plantation, Hen
Scratch Saloon, Shoofly Methodist Church, Tickfall
and Dirty Six are treated with a mixture of true local
color and far-fetched tom-foolery. The characters
have ludicrous names like Whiffletree Bone, Limit
Lark, Vakey Vopp, Dazzle Zenor, Coco Ferret, Ready
Rocket, Vinegar Atts, Skeeter Butts. Means attacks
conventional dialect, yet he makes use of invented
phrases: “explavacatin”, “permittunce,” “coming wid
a looseness,” “de orgies” (for church services), “ax
her inquirement,” “ain’t right in her intellectuals,”
“I warn’t studyin’ how to save by grace; I was ponderin’
how to save my grease.” Means regrets that
the good life lived by these naïve villagers is departing;
“Ethiopia is stretching out her hands after art,
science, literature and wealth,” Negroes are becoming
“play-like white folks.” He wishes to leave a record
of the “sable sons of laughter and song, in Fiction’s
beautiful temple of dreams.” The laughter, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
is chiefly the haw-hawing of the white folks; the
dreams are practical jokes. Something of the sinister
and ugly is recognized; Negroes at their Uplift League
election wrench legs off of tables in a free-for-all,
shot-guns and razors are frequently used, but the
picture remains quaint and comical. In almost every
story we have panic-stricken Negroes “skedaddling,”
their “ponderous feet beating a wild tattoo of panicky
retreat upon the sodded turf;” oddly enough, one
cause for fright never mentioned is a southern mob.</p>

<p>These authors contrive a rapid-fire dialogue, now
near to life (as in Akers) and now to the minstrel
show (as in Cohen). The white folks are tolerant,
until tenants burn the porches off their homes, or
servants mix up affairs too much, when they wax comically
profane. The Negroes are superstitious, helpless,
cowardly, utterly ridiculous children. Life is easy
and indolent except for shrewish wives and scheming
crooks; the razors do not cut, the scantlings used by
white masters on their menials never hurt, since they
strike the head, and the “law” is only a mythical threat.
What could be pathos and tragedy sets off laughter.
The settings are supposed to be found in Demopolis or
Birmingham or other southern cities, but they belong
to a <i>never-never</i>, cloud-cuckoo land. All in all these
stories reveal far less of Negro life and character than
of middle class American taste.</p>

<p><i>The Rising Tide of Color.</i> But there were others
who took the Negro in dead earnest. Negroes were
becoming educated, getting property, leaving the
South, and asking for civil rights; they constituted,
therefore, a menace. Southern civilization sought to
preserve itself by peonage, disfranchisement, segregation,
and lynching. The authors aided and paralleled
the politicians, who confounded attempts at democracy
by dragging the herring of intermarriage over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the countryside. In proportion as Negroes showed
themselves as seeking economic advancement and civil
rights, authors portrayed them as insulting brutes and
rapists.</p>

<p>This stereotype shot up to full growth in these first
decades of the twentieth century. But the seeds, as
we have seen, had been sown long before. Answering
abolitionist onslaughts, the <i>Bible Defense of Slavery</i>
had “proved” that Sodom and Gomorrah were strongholds
of <i>Negro</i> vice, and that “the baleful fire of
unchaste amour rages through the Negro’s blood
more fiercely....” Hinton Helper, in <i>Nojoque</i>
(1867), had set up black and beastly as synonyms.
<i>The Negro A Beast</i> (1900) by Charles Carroll
which proves the Negro to be “a beast, created with
articulate speech, that he may be of service to the
White man,” brought this type of book to a rabid
climax. As already pointed out, Page in <i>Red Rock</i>
and <i>The Negro, The Southerner’s Problem</i> had shown
Reconstruction to be a holiday for Negro brutes.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Dixon.</i> After Page, the best known author
of Ku Klux Klan fiction is the Reverend Thomas
Dixon. <i>The Clansman</i> and <i>The Leopard’s Spots</i>,
because of their sensationalism (cf. chapter titles
“The Black Peril,” “The Unspoken Terror,” “A
Thousand Legged Beast,” “The Hunt For the Animal”)
seemed just made for the mentality of early
Hollywood, where D. W. Griffith’s <i>The Birth of a
Nation</i> made for Dixon a dubious sort of immortality,
and finally fixed the stereotype in the mass-mind.</p>

<p><i>The Leopard’s Spots</i> (1902) is Dixon’s masterpiece
of hatred. This long novel has its share of
sugary love affairs done in the best southern tradition,
but is chiefly important for its political bearings.
Characters are brought in from <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>;
Legree quits drink for the greater vice of becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
a scalawag and a mill owner. Eliza’s son, George
Harris, is educated at Harvard, falls in love with
Senator Lowell’s daughter and is ordered from the
abolitionist home. Tim Shelby, a silk-hatted Negro
politician, boasts that he will one day marry a white
woman and is lynched as “Answer of the Anglo-Saxon
race to Negro lips that dare to pollute with words the
fair womanhood of the South.” Dick, an imbecile,
crushes with a rock the head of a white child and
then attacks her. The assaulted child and the burning
of the Negro are described with gusto. Drunk
Negro soldiers drag white brides from their homes;
criminal Negroes rove the countryside, forcing whites
to take to the cities. Included in the list of hateful
outragers of the fair Southland are the Yankee schoolmarms,
whom Dixon would like to see shipped back
to Boston in glass cages like rattlesnakes. The Negro
is not to be educated, not even industrially, for this
drives him to crime or suicide. A few Negroes like
old Nels obey their white-folks, but Dixon is surprised
to find no Negroes in the mob that lynched
Dick. Negro “dominion” and the threat that “the
South will become mulatto instead of Anglo-Saxon”
are overthrown when the Red-Shirts ride.</p>

<p><i>The Clansman</i> (1905) is another hymn of hate.
President Lincoln, considered pro-southern, is fearful
lest “mulatto citizenship be too dear a price to pay
even for emancipation.” Stoneman, a libellous portrait
of Thaddeus Stevens, is shown in the toils of
Lydia Brown, a mulatto of extraordinary animal
beauty. Other villains are Silas Lynch, a mulatto,
“with the head of a Caesar and the eyes of the jungle,”
Augustus Caesar, “whose flat nose with enormous
perpetually dilating nostrils, sinister head and enormous
cheekbones and jaws reminded one of the lower
order of animal,” and Yankee soldiers whom faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
ex-slaves obligingly knock down. “A new mob of
onion-laden breath, mixed with perspiring African
odour, became the symbol of American democracy.”
Against this reign of terror, culminating in a rape,
painstakingly described, the knights of the Ku Klux
Klan rise in righteous wrath. Gus, whose image was
discovered upon the retina of the dead mother’s eye
by strange southern science, is not lynched, but “executed
by the Grand Turk who flung his body on the
lawn of the black Lieutenant-Governor of the State.”
In this way civilization was restored. Reconciliation
is exemplified in northern-southern love affairs, but
only when the Negro is returned to serfdom can there
be true reunion.</p>

<p><i>The School of Page and Dixon.</i> Emory’s <i>A Maryland
Manor</i> (1901) is important only as a sign of
the trend. The slaves are shown as lighthearted,
needing compulsion to teach them good habits. Chloe,
who runs away frequently, is obeying an inherited love
for the woods: “It was often the case ... fugitives
fled from those they loved best.” From emancipation
“the negroes suffered most of all, sinking into a condition
little short of their original barbarism.” Caesar
is too intelligent to accept freedom, “What you take
me fur, anyhow?”, etc. As a reward he is allowed
burial in the family graveyard, at his master’s blessed
feet.</p>

<p>In <i>The Northerner</i> (1905) by Nora Davis, a reconciliation
novel, Falls, a Yankee businessman, establishes
the Tennessee Valley Improvement Company
to develop electric power in the South, and wins the
Alabama belle in the meanwhile. Falls and Watson,
a southern aristocrat, battle a mob to save an innocent
but craven Negro, who, given a pistol to defend his
life, thinks only: “Lawdy, don’t I wisht I had er piece
er M’lindy’s cawn bread.” Miscegenation is a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
concern of the author, who calls it the “Curse of
Dixie,” “The Nameless Shame,” “The Hidden Pain.”
Watson, in his cavalier youth, had been seduced by
the brown Lesby, “a snake in the grass.” He loathes
his beautiful quadroon daughter, Rosebud. Miss
Davis has him say: “Every drop of blood in my body
turns cold with disgust at the thought—the sight of
her!” And to his daughter, before she is relegated to
the future in store for one “cursed with the black
drop,” he declaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You should be just, child, to this man—try to see how he is
placed. He has done, and he will do, his duty by you as God
gives it to him to see it.... That was a sin of the flesh, you
know, and in the flesh will he repay. But in the spirit, in all
those things which belong to his higher nature, you can have no
part.... He could not love you, cherish you: his very nature
would recoil. It is instinct, child, blood!”</p>

<p>Rose meekly concurs. Some comic use is made of
Pete, a state Congressman in Reconstruction, now happier
as a valet for his white-folks.</p>

<p>Robert Lee Durham is even more concerned over
the “Hidden Shame” in <i>The Call of The South</i>
(1908). John Hayward, the central figure, is of
barely perceptible Negro blood. Of fine ancestry on
the white side, he is a first-rate student and athlete at
Harvard before he leaves for heroic service in the
war in Cuba. Becoming footman for a president
who champions liberal democracy, he is thrown in contact
with the president’s daughter. After rescuing her
from a runaway horse, and revealing his heroic past
at Harvard and in battle, he wins her, like a modern
Othello, by tales of dangers overcome. They marry
secretly, platonically. Up to this point the novelist
has been sympathetic toward Hayward’s undoubted
abilities and undeserved rebuffs. But the platonic
husband and wife, waylaid in a storm, are forced to
seek refuge in a hut.</p>

<p>In a flash of light she sees his face—distorted: with a shriek
of terror she wildly tries to push him from her; but the demon
of the blood of Guinea Gumbo is pitiless, and against the fury
of it, as against the storm, she fights and cries in vain.</p>
</div>

<p>The tragedy rushes on: Helen is delivered of a very
dark child, explained as a “recession”; her father dies
of heart failure; she goes mad. A South Carolina
cavalier points the moral and adorns the tale:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How shall sickly sentimentality solace your shame if in the
blood of your mulatto grandchild the vigorous red corpuscles of
some savage ancestor shall overmatch your gentle endowment?</p>

<p>For “however risen, redolent of newly applied polish,”
the leopard cannot change his spots, nor the Ethiopian
his skin. It seems that the skin must be changed for
him. Even so, the fundamental savagery is still there,
lurking. Social equality means the “mongrelization of
the superior breed,” of which one “blood deep characteristic
is chivalrous respect for women.” So rings
out the Call of the South.</p>

<p>Although a much later book, Jean Sutherland’s
<i>Challenge</i> (1926) is equally fantastic and insidious.
The Polish-English Prince Kareninoff, who is famous
as an opponent of race-mixture, has had a son by a
woman who, unknown to him, was part Negro. The
son, however, does the proper thing; he shuts himself
in a monastery to save his aristocratic fiancée from
pollution, and then, like his octoroon sisters, goes to
Africa to help his people.</p>

<p>Negro characters in John Trotwood Moore’s novels
such as <i>Ole Mistis</i> and <i>The Bishop of Cottontown</i> are
in the mildewed tradition. Mammy, in the second of
these, has a new mission: she keeps the children of her
impoverished master from the cotton mills.</p>

<p>Frenzied at the wrongs of the cotton factory, she
sets fire to the “Sodom.” For this she is nearly
lynched, but is saved by the heroes of the novel. “Thirteen
dead men lay, and the back-bone of lynching had
been broken forever in Alabama.” This was written
in 1906. Moore condones lynching as</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the result of the sudden emancipation of ignorant slaves, who,
backed by the bayonets of their liberators ... perpetuated an
unnameable crime as part of their system of revenge for years of

the hide of a broncho?</p>
</div>

<p>In one scene a group of Negro night-riders, instigated
by the villains of the Union League and a mulatto
politician, terrorize the faithful Negroes. The latter,

the virtues of the best class of whites,” while the
Negroes who wished to vote were “but a few generations
removed from the cowardice of darkest Africa.”
Lushly overflowing with love for the poor millhands,
Moore has a kind word for the Negro only as serf.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> These authors urged reconciliation of
North and South, <i>but on southern terms</i>. They shuddered
at the rising tide of bad Negroes, dreading amalgamation,
but too often “bad Negroes” to them were
the educated, or the propertied, or the militant. Their
books seem to be conceived in fear and written with
hate. They reflected the thought of the South of their
day, from planter aristocrat and political boss down
to the poor-white on the farm or in the mills. They
wanted the South left alone to deal with the Negro
in its own way, and this way, since the Negro was
needed as ignorant laborer and scapegoat, was the
way of exploitation and cruelty. These authors merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
transferred melodrama of action into written melodramas.
They were sometimes vicious, sometimes
stupid, and as in the case of Dixon, sometimes mob
inciters rather than novelists. But still, be it recorded
to democracy’s shame, they got what they wanted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">COUNTER-PROPAGANDA—BEGINNING REALISM</p>


<p><i>Negro Apologists.</i>—Aroused by the libels of
Thomas Nelson Page and his school, Negro novelists
stepped forward with race defense and glorification.
Explaining weaknesses as the heritage of slavery and
oppression, they wished to hold up to the world “the
millions of honest, God-fearing, industrious, frugal,
respectable and self-respecting Negroes, who are toiling
on for the salvation of their race.” They urged
what Kelly Miller wrote in “An Open Letter to
Thomas Dixon, Jr.” (1905):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Within forty years of only partial opportunity ... the American
Negro has cut down his illiteracy by over fifty per cent; has
produced a professional class, some fifty thousand strong ... some
three thousand Negroes have taken collegiate degrees, over
three hundred being from the best institutions in the North and
West.... Negro inventors have taken out four hundred patents
... scores of Negroes ... take respectable rank in the company
of distinguished Americans.</p>
</div>

<p>And, as another put it,—“This farm land that they
own and operate if put acre to acre would make a
strip of land five miles wide ... from New York to
San Francisco.” They believed that the Negro who
had succeeded in the American way should have his
day in court. Some agreed with Booker Washington,
more with DuBois, but all stressed the Negro’s persecution
and his achievement. The times demanded
propaganda of them, they felt; and propaganda they
gave, in good measure. The race was their hero, and
preaching a solution their business, upon which they
were grimly intent.</p>

<p>Sutton Griggs, one of the earliest, assured the
readers of <i>Unfettered</i> (1902) that neither angels nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
demons, but mere human beings made up his cast of
characters. But this is not so. Morlene is described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A wealth of lovely black hair crowning a head of perfect shape
and queenly poise; a face, the subtle charm of which baffles description;
two lustrous black eyes, wondrously expressive, presided
over by eyebrows that were ideally beautiful; a neck which,
with perfect art, descended and expanded so as to form a part
of a faultless bust; as to form, magnificently well proportioned;
when viewed as a whole, the very essence of loveliness....</p>
</div>

<p>It is no wonder then, that she speaks to one of the
villains: “Sir, it takes no prophet to foretell that terrible
sorrows await you.” The hero, Dorlan Warthell,
is likewise faultless: “As to color he was black, but
even those prejudiced as to color forgot that prejudice
when they gazed upon this ebony-like Apollo.” Dorlan,
a power in politics, deserts the Republican party
for betraying his race, and incurs the hatred of the
white Congressman Bloodworth. The ills heaped
upon ills of the southern Negro, a very idealized love
affair, long discussions of the race problem, and
Dorlan’s plan to solve it (partly worked out on a
balloon ride) make the book a hodgepodge. The prose
is trite and pompous.</p>

<p>Griggs’ <i>The Hindered Hand</i> (1905) is also a bad
novel. The characters are models of decorum. In a
passionate love scene at the end, the hero Ensal takes
one of Tiara’s hands in his, and then overwhelmed,
takes the other:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We fain would draw the curtain just here.... They were
married that night, and the next day set out for Africa, to provide
a home for the American Negro.</p>
</div>

<p>All of the darker phases of the South appear in the
book, but melodramatically, unrealistically. The action
is slowed up by long dissertations on “the problem,”
including a review of Thomas Dixon’s <i>Leopard’s Spots</i>.
Even the two heroines are race orators. George
McClellan’s <i>Old Greenbottom Inn</i> (1906) is subtler
propaganda. Most of the stories tell of the pathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
love affairs of beautiful Negro girls, but there is some
rewarding local color of the Tennessee Valley and of
the earliest Negro schools.</p>

<p>An argument in the guise of fiction is J. W. Grant’s
<i>Out of the Darkness</i> or <i>Diabolism and Destiny</i>
(1909). Answering Booker T. Washington’s conciliatory
school of thought, the author writes “What are
houses, land and money to men who are women?” But
the mettle of the author deserves a better novel. His
chief characters—the orator, the salutatorian and the
valedictorian of their college class—become noted as
preacher, statesman, and physician respectively. The
physician discovers a cure for yellow fever, saves a
beautiful white girl’s life, and is lynched before the
love affair between them ripens. He is nearly white
and bitter towards the white world; his two classmates
are likewise militant. The author continually stresses
the grace, refinement, wealth, palatial homes and
property of upper class Negroes, decries the masses,
and demands that the Negro be measured not by his
worst but by his best. Needless to say the wrongs of
the Negro are listed in full, but are seldom shown
movingly. <i>As We See It</i> (1910) by Robert L. Waring
deals with a young black hero, Abe, who leaves
scholastic and athletic honors at Oberlin College to
avenge the lynching of his mother and sister. There
is a Damon-Pythias bond between Abe and a white
boy, Malcolm, and between their two fathers, one an
Alabama aristocrat and the other his body-servant.
The aristocratic class of the South is praised highly,
while the poor-whites are treated with contempt and
hatred. Waring’s generalizations about the “cracker”
are very much like Dixon’s about Negroes.</p>

<p><i>From Superman to Man</i> (1917) by J. A. Rogers
has only a thin thread of narrative running through
long discussions of the race problem, in which a Pullman
porter embarrasses and refutes white passengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
with his anthropological and sociological information.
Quips such as “The white man’s burden is composed
largely of plunder” and “‘To educate the Negro
is only to make him unhappy’ really means ‘Do not
educate the Negro and make the white man unhappier’”
carry force, but the book is more pamphlet
then novel.</p>

<p>The apologist whom these authors praised for his
uncompromising attitude was W. E. B. DuBois. His
fiction, superior to theirs in literary value, is similar
in many respects. <i>The Quest of the Silver Fleece</i>
(1911) is part fantasy, part propaganda. Zora, who
sees visions of the “little people of the swamps,” rises
from a degraded environment to become a race leader,
fit companion for Bles Alwyn, a noble black boy from
Georgia who becomes a force in politics. The plot
is unconvincing; the characters are stiff and talk
stiltedly: “Bles, thou almost persuadest me to be a
fool.” But DuBois’ social understanding gives the
novel value. The New England schoolmarms, the
southern attack upon the schools, the scheming to get
control of Negro education to render it harmless,
the tie-up of Northern capital with cotton barons,
the shame of Negro treatment, the conniving of
political Negroes,—all of these are revealed by a
keen social analyst. DuBois sees how poor-whites are
used “to keep niggers in their place, and the fear of
niggers to keep the poorer whites in theirs.” One
white character says “Derned if I don’t think white
slaves and black slaves had ought ter git together.”
But this radical lead is not followed up; the novel is
too taken up with a priggish hero and an unbelievable
heroine, and social reality is subordinated to symbolism.
It is a significant book, however, and if DuBois
answered Dixon’s melodrama in kind, it was at least
melodrama pleading for humanity and blasting injustice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>DuBois’ <i>Darkwater: The Twentieth Century
Completion of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”</i> (1919) contains
five tales in a prose that echoes the Bible and medieval
romance. Two modern fairy-tales attack race-hatred
and oppression. “The Second Coming” tells of the
birth of a black child in a Georgia stable while three
bishops—“the wise men”—look on. “Jesus Christ
in Texas,” like Upton Sinclair’s “They Call Me Carpenter,”
deals with the return of Christ to a hate-ridden
community, where he is unrecognized by the
preacher, but is known to the despised and rejected.
Like H. G. Wells, DuBois, in “The Comet,” makes
use of pseudo-science to drive home social ideas.
When Manhattan is destroyed by the gases of a comet,
only two people survive, one a Negro bank messenger,
and the other a white girl, “rarely beautiful and richly
gowned, with darkly-golden hair and jewels.” Alone
on earth, the “Bride of Life” and “great All-Father
of the race to be” are broken in upon and returned
to the world of prejudice by the crass “honk-honk”
of rescuers from the world outside of New York City.
These stories are without the usual drive of DuBois’
work; even within the frame of allegory and fantasy,
they lack conviction.</p>

<p>James Weldon Johnson’s <i>The Autobiography of
An Ex-Colored Man</i> (1912) (first published anonymously)
urges that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>log-cabins and plantations and dialect speaking ‘darkies’ are perhaps
better known in American literature than any other single
picture.... [Too little known] are coloured people who live in
respectable homes and amidst a fair degree of culture.</p>
</div>

<p>The hero, a sensitive, light-skinned Negro, expresses
an upper-class snobbishness toward the Negro masses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The unkempt appearance, the shambling, slouching gait and
loud talk and laughter of these people aroused in me a feeling of
almost repulsion.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>Ashamed of “being identified with a people that could
with impunity be treated worse than animals,” he
decides to “pass” for white. He travels widely
through the South, to New York and to Europe,
mingling generally with artistic people. Economic
security and a happy marriage with a white woman do
not quiet his regret, however, and he calls himself a
“coward, a deserter ... [with] a strange longing for
my mother’s people.” Although the central figure
is complex and interesting, the novel seems to exist
primarily for the long discussions of race, and the
showing of the Negro in different milieus. The descriptions
of the “big meeting” and of Bohemian life
in New York are valuable realism. <i>The Autobiography
of An Ex-Colored Man</i> was a ground-breaking
novel in its dealing with the “aristocratic” mulatto,
the problem of “passing,” the Negro artistic world,
the urban and European scene, and its subtler assertion
of points where Negroes “are <i>better</i> than anybody
else.”</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> After the long years of caricature and
contempt, it was natural that Negro novelists of the
first generation after slavery should write as apologists.
Not literary men, with the exception of DuBois
and Johnson, but most often preachers and teachers,
they had a charge to keep instead of a story to be told.
They resented the use of the “Jim-Crow Negro,”
seen in Harris and Page, Dunbar and Chesnutt.
DuBois reveals a refreshing faith in the people at
times, but they all preferred the “talented tenth,” at
its most genteel. The heroines are modest and beautiful,
frequently octoroon; the heroes are handsome
and priggish, frequently black. Their characters have
high-flown names like Dorlan Warthell, Ensal Ellwood,
Tiara and Bles Alwyn; between these and comic
names like Shakespeare Shackleford, Vakey Vopp, and
Epic Peters there is little to choose. The villains are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
too often poor-whites. The incidents are romantic
and often fantastic. The injuries of the Negro are
seldom conveyed with full power; like the abolitionists,
these novelists felt that listing could make up for
rendering. The race problem, at the core of their
work, turns their novels into tracts. Acceptance of
certain traits as racial, such as optimism, loyalty and
faith, and underestimation of the Negro masses invalidate
much of their discussion. All are concerned
with refutation of Thomas Dixon and his school.
They were fighting in a good cause, but the novel
was not their weapon.</p>

<p><i>The Tradition of The Abolitionists.</i> Negro apologists
found allies among northern white liberals who
joined in the struggle for Negro rights. Mary White
Ovington, one of the important figures in the National
Association For The Advancement of Colored People,
wrote persuasive propaganda fiction. <i>The Shadow</i>
(1920) makes out a case for Negroes against the white
world. A white girl, abandoned by her aristocratic
family, is brought up as colored, until a letter informs
her of her lineage. Her experiences in the white
world, complicated by coincidental meetings with her
Negro “brother,” disillusion her, and she says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>White people are wicked.... They hate goodness.... And
they say they’re so good!... We black people, we are bad....
Well, I want to be with bad people. I’ve been with good people
as long as I can bear....</p>
</div>

<p>The novel is worked out romantically. Its pattern
and many of its situations, however, have been taken
over by later novelists. Miss Ovington is likewise
the author of <i>Hazel</i> (1913), a story of a little colored
heroine, and the much better <i>Zeke</i> (1931), which is an
informed and sympathetic novel of the life of Negro
boys in a southern school. Her “The White Brute”
has been called one of the most memorable stories
against lynching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>Dorothy Canfield’s <i>The Bent Twig</i> (1915) refers to
race prejudice in a midwestern town. When two
shy, well-bred girls are discovered to have Negro
blood, their schoolmates taunt them gleefully. An
intelligent liberal—grieved at the humiliation—feels
like gathering up his family and going away from the
intolerable question, to Europe, but his wife grimly
remarks: “And what we shall do is, of course, nothing
at all.”</p>

<p>Typical of the many works urging the solution of
the race problem by applied Christianity is <i>Of One
Blood</i> (1916) by Charles Sheldon, the author of the
religious best-seller <i>In His Steps</i>. Sheldon admits that
he has pictured the “heroic, the beautiful and the
great of each race,” but insists that he has not done
them justice. The Negro hero is shown as triumphant
college orator, great athlete, and finally agricultural
expert instructing his people. Although nearly lynched
in the South, being rescued melodramatically by a
southern member of the “World Brotherhood,” he
will not be “angry, sullen, bitter or revengeful.” The
author concludes that race hatred would be abolished
if “all the white men in the United States were like
Abraham Lincoln and all the black men like Booker
Washington,” a hope as extreme as his characterization
and plot. Likewise full of praise for Booker
Washington, <i>The Testing Fire</i> by Alexander Corkey
(1911) optimistically prophesies a redeemed South.</p>

<p><i>Early Southern Liberalism.</i>—Groping and hesitant
liberalism found expression in the work of some of the
southern novelists. Some were aware of the heavy
hand of the dead past and wanted to shake it off,
others wanted to set down honestly what they saw
about them. <i>The Southerner</i> (1909) first appeared
as a serial, <i>The Autobiography of a Southerner Since
the Civil War</i>, by Nicholas Worth, whom readers
soon identified as Walter Hines Page. The attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
of this book upon the “mummified” South, its dedication
to the laying of the three ghosts of “The Confederate
Dead, of Religious Orthodoxy and of Negro
Domination,” shows how opposed Walter Hines Page
of North Carolina was to the ghost-ridden Thomas
Nelson Page of Virginia. The novel is long and tract-like.
Negro characters play an important part. Uncle
Ephraim and Aunt Maria, worshippers of their white
family, remember slavery as a happy state. Balancing
these are Sam Worth, the runaway slave who becomes
head of an industrial school; Lissa, another tragic
mulatto, who bears a child to the future governor of
the state; the Rev. Doctor Snodder, meek hang-dog
“teacher of the oppressed”; John Marshall, an intelligent
Hampton graduate; gullible office seekers, and
a murderer of a Confederate firebrand. The author
of <i>The Southerner</i> had, for his time, advanced ideas
regarding education, civil rights, and democracy, and
these are reflected in his characterizations of Negroes,
which, though not done at full-length, are suggestive
departures from the old and outworn.</p>

<p>Ellen Glasgow, who “carried realism across the
Potomac” to the interpretation of her beloved Virginia,
naturally pays attention to the Negro. He
appears, however, as part of the social background,
not as central character. He is viewed with shrewd
insight: in <i>The Miller of Old Church</i> (1911) a Negro
farmer, told to be thankful for his crop instead of complaining,
responds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dar ain’t nuttin’ ’tall ter be thankful fur in dat, suh, case de
Lawd He ain’t had no mo ter do wid dat ar co’n den old Marse
Hawtrey. I jes ris dat ar co’n wid my own han’ right down de
road at my front do’, and po’d de water on hit outer de pump
at my back un. I’se monstrous glad ter praise de Lawd for what
he done done, but I ain’t gwine to gin ’im credit fur de wuk er
my own fis’ en foot.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Barren Ground</i> (1925) contains some honest pictures
of Negroes, not greatly different from the impoverished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
whites of the broomsedge, except that they are
better and thriftier farmers. With courage Miss
Glasgow introduces the common-law wife of old man
Graylock. Once a handsome Negro woman, she is
now slatternly and smoulderingly resentful, especially
when the old man in a drunken fit takes a horsewhip
to his mulatto brood.</p>

<p>The Negro character as a very different sort of
background appears in <i>Hagar’s Hoard</i>, by George
Kibbe Turner (1920). This gripping novel tells of
the horror of yellow fever as it came to the close-shuttered
houses of Memphis. Negroes serve as a
mysterious, sinister chorus. Memphis is conjured
vividly before the reader: “that long ragged line of
old brick blocks—that rendezvous of niggers and
thieves—the bad niggers, and the murderers and the
nigger thieves.” Then there are the sanctified Negroes,
“The Hollering Saints,” who are certain that the
yellow fever is “the punishment of God acomin’ down
on Memphis.” Individualized Negroes are Arabella,
the faithful house servant, fanatically awaiting the
coming of the Lamb; Make Haste Mose, the driver
of the dead wagon, and a saddle-colored Negro with
an immense scar, lying in wait to rob. All of these,
according to the southern boy who tells the story, are
unfathomable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All white folks knew was what they generally know about
niggers—that bowing and scraping; those brown masks—those
faces with all their muscles trained since the sin of Ham in the
Bible; since they went out in slavery and subjection—to lie still
and show nothing. And those old brown eyes, watching, watching.</p>
</div>

<p>Under the pen name of “George Madden Martin,”
Mrs. Atwood R. Martin wrote many stories of southern
Negro life. “Her Husband” concerns a lynching.
When Edith Thornberry, a white woman of gentle
birth, discovers that her husband, a poor white, has
reverted to type and led the lynchers, she is set against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
him. She was “bracketed with those thousands of
southern men and women who speak a universal
language of decency,” but her husband was bracketed
with “a pusillanimous multitude, skulkers ever behind
the decent South, lynchers, night-riders, white caps,
Ku Klux.” Unfortunate in its connection of heredity
with decency, the story is still significant for the sharp
protest of an intelligent southern woman against mob-violence.
<i>Children of The Mist</i> (1920) decries the
work of agitators upon Negroes, but is by no means
merely Thomas Nelson Page brought up to date.</p>

<p><i>Stirrings of Realism.</i>—When, at the turn of the
century, authors showed a willingness to deal seriously
with uneasy segments of American life, the Negro
made his demand upon them. It is significant that most
of the early figures prominent in the history of twentieth
century realism dealt in some measure with the
Negro. Among them are Stephen Crane, Upton Sinclair,
Theodore Dreiser and Gertrude Stein.</p>

<p>Stephen Crane’s work was generally too advanced
for the sentimental readers of his age, and “The
Monster” (1897) was particularly so. This story of
horror lashes out at the stupidity and heartlessness
of a small American town. Henry Johnson, a Negro
hostler, rescues a small boy from a fire. Falling,
overcome by the fumes in the burning laboratory, he
has his face eaten away by acid. The boy’s father,
Dr. Trescott, exercises his best skill and keeps Henry
alive. When Henry was thought to be dying, he was
lauded as hero and martyr; but kept alive, a faceless
imbecile, he meets with terror and hatred, among the
better class as well as in Watermelon Alley. “The
Monster” is more a sharp satire of a small town’s
intolerance than a study of Negroes, but it has secondary
meanings that pertain to Negro life in what it
tells of service, sacrifice, and false affection that goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
over into revulsion. The few pictures of Negro life
here and in <i>Whilomville Stories</i> are done with the
vividness to be expected from Stephen Crane.</p>

<p>Negro characters in Upton Sinclair’s <i>The Jungle</i>
(1905) are only incidental, but they are drawn in
grim earnest. He shows Negroes as strikebreakers,
brought into Packingtown from the levees or the
country districts of the far South on promises of five
dollars a day and board, with special rates from railroads.
The harsh life of scabs makes them surly and
dangerous; most of them have knives, ground to fine
points, hidden in their boots. “Whiskey and women
were brought in by the carload and sold to them, and
hell was let loose in the yards.” After the strike,
these “green” Negroes, together with foreigners and
criminals, are turned loose in thousands upon Chicago.
This sketch of the Negro worker, denied admission
to unions and thereby forced to the role of strikebreaker,
anticipates much of present-day proletarian
fiction.</p>

<p>Carl Van Vechten considers Gertrude Stein’s
“Melanctha” in <i>Three Lives</i> (1909) to be “perhaps
the first American story in which the Negro is regarded ... not
as an object for condescending compassion
or derision.” “Melanctha” is a slowly
unwound character study of a “subtle, intelligent,
half-white girl, Melanctha Herbert,” who “always
wanted peace and quiet, and always she could only
find new ways to get excited.” Her chief love affairs
are painstakingly set forth. The characters talk in a
mannered dialogue; they all sound like each other,
and like the white people in the other two stories.
Gertrude Stein speaks of “the wide abandoned laughter
that gives the broad glow to negro sunshine,” but
her major characters do not have it. The people she
calls “decent,” she likewise calls unmoral and promiscuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
or shows them in razor brawls. White blood
in one character “made her see clear,” and gave “her
grit and endurance and vital courage,” but the power
and breakneck courage in Melanctha came to her from
her big black virile father. In spite of these dubious
generalizings, “Melanctha” is important. Though not
realistic in the usual sense, it gives a convincing portrait
of a mysterious, uncertain girl, “wandering in her
ways,” doomed to tragedy, a Negro Madame Bovary
or Esther Waters.</p>

<p>Setting out early to chart “tragic America,” Theodore
Dreiser wrote “Nigger Jeff” (1918) about a
lynching. Dreiser does not make the Negro innocent,
but he shows with somber power the mob hysteria in
a town ironically called Pleasant Valley, the bravery
of the sheriff, the horror of the captured Negro, and
the final hanging to the bridge. And then he goes
farther, to the mother and sister of the victim, and
without sentimentality shows their grief. “I’ll get it
all in,” exclaimed the young reporter who covered the
case. And Dreiser got it all in, to make one of his
best stories.</p>

<p><i>Again The Tragic Mulatto.</i>—Two writers of some
repute returned to the theme of the tragic mulatto.
Less romantic than their predecessors, they still cling
to old stereotypes. Margaret Deland’s “A Black
Drop” (1908) tells of Lily, who, although brought
up in Nigger Hill, a section of a midwestern town,
by Mammy, a fair Negro woman, “cushiony and
weighing two hundred and fifty pounds,” is considered
white. Lily’s love affair with Framely Stone, son of
abolitionists, is broken up. Miss Wales, his New
England Sunday School teacher, points out proof of
the girl’s Negro blood, clinching her case by mentioning
her use of “heavy perfumery.” Miss Deland
believes that intermarriage is forbidden by disgust,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
“a race protest, a race horror ... organic, biological.”
Instinct, it seems, revolts at intermarriage, but not at
liaisons. Confusing and unconvincing, “A Black Drop”
is still not entirely without sympathy and insight.</p>

<p>In the short story “Carter” (1921) Don Marquis
is likewise concerned with one of the many mulattoes
who in fiction tragically yearn “oh to be white, white,
white!” After “passing” for a short while in New
York, he returns to Atlanta, resolved to live and die
among Negroes. He arrives there at the time of a
riot, and witnesses “the conflict which was forever
active in his own nature.” He is happy when he is
taken for a white man of the better class by his own
white half-brother, but is plunged into misery when,
dying, he is re-identified as “a yaller nigger.” Carter’s
abjectness, and the flattery of whites are laid on a bit
too heavily. Although the story abounds in clichés
about mulatto character, it does approach Negro life,
especially the Atlanta riot, with seriousness.</p>

<p>John Bennett’s <i>Madame Margot</i> (1921) is the
legend of a golden Creole who, in order to keep her
ivory daughter from dishonor and betrayal, “to keep
her white to all eternity,” sells herself to Satan.
Margot’s sultry beauty turns to grotesqueness. As
old Mother Go-go, in the dirty Negro quarters, black
now instead of ruddy gold, she is claimed by the devil.
An other-worldly romance, <i>Madame Margot</i>, for all
of its imaginative remoteness, conveys something of
what women like Madame Margot knew in bitter
actuality.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> The tendencies seen in this chapter are
diverse, ranging from the race-glorification of Negro
apologists to social realism by important American
novelists. At times, as in the case of the tragic
mulatto, the work seems conventional, but in the main
we notice that authors are beginning to take the Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
seriously, revising earlier stereotypes, and breaking
the ground for later realism. The work that they
did is little known, but it is important in the evolution
of the Negro character in American fiction.</p>

</div>

<p class="c">REALISM AND THE FOLK</p>


<p><i>Sociological Realism.</i>—T. S. Stribling’s <i>Birthright</i>
(1922) brought something new in the treatment of
Negro life. The novel looks back in its problem and
its preaching, and has its share of superstitions about
“race” such as that Negroes howl their agony aloud
and white men bottle up their grief, and that “to a
white man absolute idleness is impossible ... he must
... do something to burn up the accumulating sugar in
his muscles.” Peter Siner is not completely credible:
a Harvard graduate, he comes back South talking like
a dictionary, urging “autonomous development” of
his people, and yet he is easily swindled by a white
banker. His marriage to Cissie, light-fingered and
ruined by a white lout, is strained, to say the least.
His opposite, Tump Pack, is caricatured. But Stribling
does protest against the southern belief that all
Negroes are carefree and happy. His description of
Negro lodges, funerals, and workaday life are authentic.
Most important of all, <i>Birthright</i> places the Negro
at the center of the picture, attempts to show the influence
of environment upon character, is ironic at the
vaunted southern understanding of Negroes, and attacks
injustice. The following description is quite
different from the pastoral shabbiness that delighted
Ruth McEnery Stuart, E. K. Means, and Paul
Laurence Dunbar:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the edge of Hooker’s Bend, drawn in a rough semi-circle
around the Big Hill, lies Niggertown.... The grimy cabins lean
at crazy angles, some propped with poles....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> Up
and down its streets flows the slow negro life of the village.... The
public well itself lies at the southern end of this miserable
street, just at the point where the drainage of the Big Hill
collects.... [To this hole in soft clay, where occasionally pigs
fall in and drown] come the unhurried colored women, who
throw in their buckets, and with dexterity that comes with long
practice draw them out full of water.... The inhabitants of
Niggertown suffer from divers diseases; they develop strange ailments
that no amount of physicking will overcome.... About
once a year the state health officer visits Hooker’s Bend and
forces the white soda-water dispensers on the other side of the
hill to sterilize their glasses in the name of the sovereign State
of Tennessee.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Nigger</i> by Clement Wood (1922) compresses a
very great deal into its less than three hundred pages.
This, too, is a sociological novel, picturing a Negro
family from its origins in slavery to modern life in
Birmingham. After freedom, Jake’s burden of debt
on his little place grows heavier each year. Forced
to flee when white hoodlums run rampant on a periodic
lynch-fest, Jake takes his seven grandchildren to Birmingham,
to realize the “emancipation” he has heard
of so often. But one son, Pink, dies in France, a
hero; another, Louis, decorated in France for bravery
is shot down by the law; Tom, embittered and violent,
becomes a criminal, and Dave’s love of learning is
dulled by the steel mills. The daughters fare no better.
The characters are completely convincing: the
trustful Jake is balanced by Jim Gaines who kills a
white man to defend his daughter. Reverend Elisha
Kirkman—“who had seen slavery ... was weazened
and sharp-tongued and wise; black and white feared
the sting that hung in his words”—is new in books
about Negroes, but is not, because of that, unconvincing.
Even the “bad Negroes” are not Dixon’s brutes;
having seen lynchings and the flagrant hypocrisy of the
law, they are desperadoes through complete cynicism.
Wood presents his characters with great knowledge
and sympathy; the little family’s anguished but doomed
efforts to get along are tragically moving. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
humor in the book, but it is mainly grim. Louis, called
upon by white examiners to recite the Constitution
before he can vote, orates Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.
The examiner is amazed and half apologetic:
“I’m damned. I didn’ think you knew it ... I didn’
think any nigger knew it.”</p>

<p><i>White and Black</i> (1922) by H. A. Shands gives a
realistic picture of Texas plantation life, where instead
of kindly whites and affectionate uncles and mammies,
there are landlords struggling to get money, and
Negroes at work in the Johnson and Bermuda grass
trying to get a bare living. Joe Williams, an aspiring
Negro share-cropper tries to bring up his daughters
decently and is almost frenzied when Ella is seduced
by the planter’s son. Ulysses Mulberry who “ain’t
done a thing except lay around ever since he’s been
back and has been runnin’ me down to the niggers
and stirrin’ em up about the low wages paid on the
farm, and jes’ playin’ the big Ike gen’r’lly,” is lynched
for outraging a poor-white girl, in a scene powerfully
presented. Richard Sanders, the preacher, starts as
a new character, forward-looking and thoughtful, if
over-academic in his language, but ends up typically,
finding his Bathsheba in a fast woman who affects
penitence. The revived Ku Klux Klan is shown punishing
Henry Thompson, a white man who openly
acknowledges his Negro children, although its ranks
are filled with men having clandestine affairs with
Negro women. Shands has gleams of irony, but he
does not let his sympathies develop to fullness, and his
book therefore lacks drive. Dorothy Scarborough’s
<i>In The Land of Cotton</i> (1923) also deals with Texas,
containing snapshots of Negro life and some fine folk-songs,
presented with the sympathetic approach of a
folk-lorist. The picture is generally pastoral. Realistic
pictures of Negroes in turpentine camps help to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
redeem Vara Majette’s <i>White Blood</i> (1924), but the
melodrama of the swamp octoroon is still traditional
and unconvincing.</p>

<p><i>South Carolina Folk.</i> The work of Ambrose
Gonzales, begun at the end of the last century but
mainly accomplished in the nineteen-twenties, is an
example of southern anecdotage. Gonzales writes as
two people: one, intent upon pugnaciously defending
the lost cause, and the other, keenly interested in the
little dramas of the Gullah folk of South Carolina.
<i>The Black Border</i> (1922) contains a passage on
Thomas Nelson Page’s failure to deal fully with
Negro life, but this book and <i>The Captain</i> (1924)
are merely extensions of works like Page’s <i>Pastime
Stories</i> and go in no new directions. The hunting and
fishing, the marital irregularities, the hog and chicken
stealing of the black-border Negroes are told with
gusto, but hardships and tragedies are glossed over.
Gonzales gets closest to realism in his care for the
language. He has studied the Gullah dialect with so
much zeal that the reader’s task is uneasy. <i>With
Aesop Along The Black Border</i> is a sly, witty rendition
of the old fables into the odd speech; the following
concludes “The Fox And The Grapes”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bumbye ’e git up en’ ’e walk off, en’ ’e walk berry sedate.
Attuwhile ’e biggin fuh grin. ’E suck ’e teet, en’ ’e say to ’eself,
’e say, “Me yent hab time fuh w’ary me bone en’ t’ing fuh jump
attuh no sour grape lukkuh dem. Soon es Uh smell’ ’um Uh
know dem <i>done</i> fuh sour! No, suh! Ef Uh haffuh chaw t’ing
lukkuh dat, Uh gwine hunt green possimun....” Buh Fox
smaa’t!</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time that Gonzales was publishing,
DuBose Heyward, sensitive and sympathetic, was taking
notes upon Negro life in Charleston to appear as
<i>Porgy</i> (1925). This novel is rightly influential. In
a poem at the outset Heyward pleads for “great hearts
to understand.” His characterization is admirable;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
he knows a great deal, and he sees the pity as well as
the laughter. His hero is Porgy, a crippled beggar,
whose love for Crown’s Bess regenerates her. The
setting, Catfish Row, a squalid tenement; the saucer-burial
scene, the spirituals and the folk-speech, the
steamboat picnic, the furtive fear of the “white” law
are conveyed with brilliant poetic realism. One of the
best bits of writing is the description of the September
storm when Catfish Row sends out its doomed riders
to the sea. The finale of the novel, presenting a Negro
as <i>tragic hero</i> is worth quoting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The keen autumn sun flooded boldly through the entrance and
bathed the drooping form of the goat, the ridiculous wagon, and
the bent form of the man in hard satirical radiance. In its revealing
light, Maria saw that Porgy was an old man. The early
tension that had characterized him, the mellow mood that he had
known for one eventful summer, both had gone; and in their
place she saw a face that sagged wearily.... She looked until
she could bear the sight no longer; then she stumbled into her
shop and closed the door, leaving Porgy and the goat alone in an
irony of morning sunlight.</p>
</div>

<p>The same willingness to see Negroes as heroic is
also in <i>Mamba’s Daughters</i> (1925). “Libel on the
South—nothing less than plain libel.... Who, in
pity’s name, from a section which is famous for its
aristocracy, elected to go and hunt up Negroes to be
sung about?” are the words of one of the novel’s
patrician ladies. Heyward so elects, giving us a heart-warming
chronicle of two women, Mamba and Hagar,
whose selfless devotion to Lissa transcends the usual
characterization of Negroes. Mamba is the untraditional
mammy: sly, ironic and ambitious for her
own. Hagar, an illiterate and grotesque Amazon,
attains nobility in her fierce laboring and fighting for
her daughter. Lissa, who owes her career as a singer
to Mamba’s generalship and Hagar’s sacrifices, does
not reach the stature of these, but is nevertheless a
new figure in the gallery of Negro characters. Heyward’s
setting—Catfish Row, the phosphate mines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
upper Negro circles striving for gentility, are conveyed
with authenticity, if not finality. Despite a few incidents
of exaggerated humor, such as Mamba’s appropriating
the Judge’s false teeth, the tone is serious.
The exploitation in the mines and the travesty of
justice meted out to the Negro are dispassionately
noted. Heyward’s “The Half-Pint Flask” (1927),
one of America’s best stories of terror, is skillfully
set against a background of Gullah superstitions,
authentically handled.</p>

<p>Another South Carolinian, Julia Peterkin, is like
DuBose Heyward in her intimacy with her material,
and her dealing with Negroes as foreground <i>characters</i>
and not as background <i>types</i>. Only occasionally
do white people enter her narratives: here are Negroes
seen in terms of their own quite important lives. Mrs.
Peterkin, who is the mistress of a plantation like the
“Blue Brook Plantation” of her fiction, insists about
her Negro characters: “I like them. They are my
friends, and I have learned so much from them.”
<i>Green Thursday</i> (1924) bore witness to the liking
for these people. It is a simple and touching group of
connected short stories. Kildee, the central figure,
with his growing love for Missie; Rose, cross in her
perplexity, but human; Maum Hannah who burned
the new house of the “po’ buckra” who was dispossessing
her, all are pictured with tenderness and insight.
Folk-beliefs and ways are set down without condescension;
the speech is Gullah, but modified from Gonzales’
phonetic transcriptions; and the description of natural
scenery is done with beauty and originality. <i>Green
Thursday</i> is, all in all, a minor classic.</p>

<p><i>Black April</i> (1927) differs. Here the colors are
stronger. Although the upbringing of the boy Breeze
has the simplicity and poetry of <i>Green Thursday</i>, the
other half of the novel is at times violently primitive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
In spite of the church, Blue Brook Plantation is
amoral. The foreman, Black April, is a great man
for working and fighting, and a greater for love
affairs, his “outside” children far outnumbering what
he calls his “yard children.” The book furnishes a
storehouse of folk-lore; long catalogues of signs and
folk-cures alternating with scenes of hunting, fishing,
fighting, conversion, and love-making. For all of its
horror Black April’s death scene approaches the
heroic. Dying after his feet have rotted off from
gangrene, he forces out these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Bury me in a man-size box—You un’erstan?... I—been—six
feet—fo’—Uncle—six feet—fo’!” The blaze in his eyes fell back,
cold, dim. A long shudder swept over him. The tide had turned.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Scarlet Sister Mary</i> (1928) won for Mrs. Peterkin
the Pulitzer Prize. There is no denying the grasp of
her material nor the power of certain scenes in this
work and the succeeding <i>Bright Skin</i> (1932), but
something just as noticeable is the increasing accent
upon exotic primitivity. Sister Mary, abandoned by
July, who is wild and footloose, becomes the scarlet
woman of the quarters, having love-affairs and love-children
with startling regularity. Mary’s pagan freedom
endears her to Mrs. Peterkin, who deplores
Puritan hypocrisy. Nevertheless the book has lapses
into condescension; “Unex” for “unexpected” is one
of the children’s names, and Mary has twins the same
night that her unmarried daughter bears her child in
a woodshed. This is belaboring with a vengeance.
<i>Bright Skin</i> is not so concerned with the plantation
birth-rate as with the death-rate, which is very high
from violent causes. A quiet death in bed seems as
unusual for these folk as for the ancient Anglo-Saxons.
Mrs. Peterkin is much less sympathetic to Cricket,
“the bright-skin,” and to bizarre Harlem, than to
Blue, the pure type Negro, and primitive Blue Brook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>What these two books leave suspect <i>Roll Jordan,
Roll</i> (1933) brings out into the open. Acclaimed by
her publishers as the “outstanding chronicler of the
American black man’s life,” Mrs. Peterkin in this
book advances trite generalizations that go back to
<i>Swallow Barn</i>, contradicts her own evidence, and is
more concerned with apologetics for white southerners
than with revelations of Negro character. The picture
she gives is one of Arcadian simplicity and happiness,
away from the evils of industrialism. Negroes are
superior to whites: “Better to be poor and black and
contented with whatever God sends than to be vast-rich
and restless.” Since Negro school-children will
come into their legacy of “ancient earthly wisdom” it
is no tragedy that Negro schools are open only from
harvest to planting time. Poverty, ignorance, disease
and exploitation are lightly touched upon or omitted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Plantation days may be hard sometimes if <i>the moon gets contrary</i>....
Their stories and songs teach the children to look for
victory from the disadvantages <i>to which life has sentenced them</i>,
when death takes their souls to heaven. (Italics mine.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Negro’s fear of the chain-gang is airily waved
away: “Courtesy and kindliness are the law of the
land.” It does Mrs. Peterkin disservice to consider
her <i>the</i> interpreter of <i>the Negro</i>. She is, instead, a
plantation mistress who sees with sympathy and intimacy
a few characters in a restricted segment of
South Carolina, from a highly specialized point of
view.</p>

<p>The recorder of another section of South Carolina,
not so far off, has a different tale to tell. A slim
volume called <i>Congaree Sketches</i> (1927) was immediately
recognized as one of the most faithful representations
of Negro folk life. The author, E. C. L.
Adams, a physician of Columbia, S. C., kept out of
the scene, and allowed his Negro characters to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
for themselves. The result was neither sentimentality
nor clowning. In a poetic dialect, Tad and Scipio and
other spokesmen built up a most convincing picture of
Negro life and character “down in de big swamps,
down in de land of mosquito, down on de Congaree.”
There are folk-tales, sermons and prayers, but chiefly
stories in dialogue dealing with dances, hot suppers,
wakes, bootlegging, church services, farming, and the
chain gang. The tone varies from rich comedy, such
as that of the Hopkins Negro who throws heaven into
an uproar, and of Ole Sister who does the same for
hell, down to the restrained but powerful satires of
southern justice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After while ole man Hall walk up to Noah an’ bus’ him over
de head wid er axe halve and beat him up ... an’ Jedge Foolbird
axe ole man Hall what de nigger do ... an’ ole man Hall
say ‘He ain’t do nuthin’, but he look like he goin’ say sumpin,’
and Jedge Foolbird fined Noah one hunnerd dollars.”</p>

<p>Voice: “What did he do wid ole man Hall?”</p>

<p>Perk: “He fine him fi’ dollars....”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Adams’ second book, <i>Nigger to Nigger</i>, is
fuller and even more forceful. The title suggests the
method. Here Negroes are assumed to be talking to
themselves, without any eavesdroppers, although the
author reveals that he has listened closely, and has
been privileged with confidences. As a result the
humor is true folk humor, and the bitterness at social
injustice is undiluted. There is fine laughter in “The
Telephone Call,” but most of the tales are tragic.
“Fifteen Years” is the Negroes’ brooding summary
of the “Ben Bess Case” where a Negro, envied by
white neighbors, was framed on a rape charge. “A
Damn Nigger” is one of the harshest stories to come
out of the new realism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jake was a nigger. De judge were a kind judge—a good man—wuh
ain’ b’lieve in too severe punishment for white folks when
a nigger is kilt, ain’ matter wha’ kind er white folks—And de
solicitor wha’ prosecute an’ see dat de criminal git he full jues is
a merciful man. An’ he got great ideas er bein’ light in punishment
of dem white mens.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>
<p>Some of the sketches deal with slavery, in a manner
far removed from the plantation tradition. The unusual
chorus of Tad and Scipio and their fellows
reveals that though they may be unlettered, they are
cynical realists, and are certainly not being fooled.
When Reverend Hickman urges Christian forbearance
he is met with taunts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dere ain’ no use. De courts er dis land is not for niggers.
Ain’ nothin’ but for’em but a gun an’ a knife in a white man’s
hand, an’ den de grave, an’ sorrow an’ tear for he people. De
Bible say, “De Lord watcheth de fall of every sparrow,” an’ I
says: “Why ain’t He take He eye off sparrow an’ luh ’em rest
some time on bigger game?”</p>
</div>

<p><i>Nigger to Nigger</i> gets more of the true picture of
Negro life in the South than do most other books combined.
And the picture, for all of Dr. Adams’ mastering
of humor, is not a pleasant one to linger over.</p>

<p>Acquainted with Gullah Negroes and dialect from
their earliest days, Samuel Gaillard Stoney and Gertrude
Mathews Shelby have retold in <i>Black Genesis</i>
(1930) the charming fables of guileful Br’ Rabbit
and foiled Br’ Wolf, short-tempered Br’ Wasp, Br’
Alligator, Br’ Frog, Br’ Partridge and Sis’ Nanny
Goat, together with free biblical reinterpretations of
the creation of the world, of Adam, Eve, Cain and
Abel, and the beginning of the race problem. In one
of the best stories, Br’ Rabbit pesters God for a longer
tail; God assigns him difficult tasks to get rid of him.
Smart and cocky, Br’ Rabbit turns up again with his
tasks completed, surprising and throwing God out of
patience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>’Bout dat time, God in de Big House look out de window to see

<p><i>Folk of the Deep South.</i> R. Emmet Kennedy speaks
of the Louisiana Negroes he knows so well as “unlettered
folk who have not lost the gracious charm of
being natural: wonderfully gifted and fairly tingling
with poetic tendencies.” His enthusiasm accounts for
good essays upon their music and their patois. But
<i>Black Cameos</i> (1924), Kennedy’s first book, is more
marked by picturesque dialect and songs than by penetration
into character. <i>Mellows</i>, a collection of folk
“melodies” includes charming vignettes of life along
the dusty roads of the delta.</p>

<p>In <i>Gritny People</i> (1927) Kennedy goes deeper.
His aim is to portray a community opposite New
Orleans. The plan is an old one: people of different
types gather at old Aunt Susan Smiley’s cook-shop, and
tell their stories, or are told about. A cross section of
rural life results: there is tragedy as well as comedy,
and the life-story of Gussie is especially moving. <i>Red
Bean Row</i> (1929) is an episodic novel; Kennedy’s
abilities, like those of earlier local colorists, seem best
fitted for the short story. The narrative is partly a
satire of a philandering elder, and a traditional story
of old Gramma Veenia’s devotion to a weakling white
man of “quality.” Kennedy faithfully conveys a way
of life. Here and there he shows the injustices of the
section; the fire company is indifferent to the burning
Negro shanty, and one woman speaks almost like Dr.
Adams’ Tad: “But white folks has a seecut way of
handlin’ the law to suit their own mind, and a poor
simple nigger has to take just what comes along.” All
in all, however, <i>Red Bean Row</i> does not match <i>Gritny
People</i>.</p>

<p>With a Negro for a nurse and Negroes for playmates,
having paid devoted attention to Negroes in
the fields, in the levee camps, on the river, in church,
at picnics and funerals, Roark Bradford is, as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
publishers state, amply qualified to write about the
Negro. Their further assertion (duplicate of her
publishers’ claim for Mrs. Peterkin) “that Roark
Bradford is perhaps better fitted to write of the southern
Negro than anyone in the United States” is hardly
attested by his work. In a foreword to “<i>Ol’ Man
Adam An’ His Chillun</i>” (1928) Bradford repeats the
platitudes about Negro character that have been used
to sanction injustice since proslavery days. There is
no indication from later books that Bradford has
changed: his Negroes are nothing but easy-come,
easy-go children, creatures of laughter and of song.
What other observers have recorded, Bradford, for
all his wide experience, has not yet seen.</p>

<p><i>Ol’ Man Adam An’ His Chillun</i> is rip-roaring
burlesque, a book of tall tales told by an imaginative
humorist in the fine tradition of Mark Twain. A
mythical preacher of the old school brings Biblical
stories down from heaven to the realistic setting of
the delta:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Well, a long time ago things was diffrunt. Hit wa’nt nothin’
on de yearth ’cause hit wa’nt no yearth. And hit wa’nt nothin’
nowheres and ev’day was Sunday. Wid de Lawd r’ared back
preachin’ all day long ev’y day. ’Ceptin’ on Sadday, and den
ev’ybody went to de fish fry.... So one day ev’ybody was out to
de fish fry, eatin’ fish and biled custard and carryin’ on, to all at
once de Lawd swallowed some biled custard which didn’t suit
his tase....</p>
</div>

<p>For all the truth to idiom, this is obviously not Negro
religion. The difference between the personified God
in the spirituals, and God with a fedora upon his head
and a ten-cent segar in his mouth should be apparent
to anyone in the least familiar with Negro believers
and their dread of sacrilege. <i>The Green Pastures</i>,
suggested by <i>Ol’ Man Adam An’ His Chillun</i>, did
something toward getting reverence and awe back
into the material, but here it is pure farce. <i>King David</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
<i>and the Philistine Boys</i> (1930) repeats this formula,
with flagging powers.</p>

<p><i>This Side of Jordan</i> (1929) is naturalistic local
color. Elder Videll, muddy-colored like the river
(Bradford does not like mulattoes), is a lustful villain.
He is killed by Scrap in a scene that sheds more
light on Bradford than on Negro character: “The
blade of a razor flashed through the air.... <i>Her
Negro blood sent it unerringly between two ribs. Her
Indian blood sent it back for an unnecessary second
and third slash.</i>” One surmises that her refusal to
be chilled with horror might be attributed to her
Esquimo blood. <i>John Henry</i> (1932), for all of its
amusing folk-speech and lore, belittles the hero. He
is changed, not for the better, from a steel driving
railroad man to a cotton-toting roustabout, from a
great working class hero to a woman’s fool. Bradford
has taken undue liberties with folk stuff of dignity and
power. The best of Bradford’s many short stories
have been collected in <i>Let the Band Play Dixie</i>
(1935). Some, like “Child of God” have ingenuity
and tenderness, others are first-rate folklore and mulelore,
and some show exotics in honkey-tonks going
native with a vengeance. The characterization is conventional;
for all of his comic genius, Bradford too
often merely brings the plantation tradition up to date.</p>

<p>In 1928, Howard Odum, one of America’s leading
sociologists, turned to fiction. Dr. Odum had already
interpreted the Negro in his collaboration with Guy
Johnson on <i>The Negro and His Songs</i> and <i>Negro
Workaday Songs</i>. <i>Rainbow Round My Shoulder</i> is
an attempt to render fiction sociological. The hero,
Left Wing Gordon, is a garrulous roustabout, rambling
from job to job, and from one teasing brown to
another. Left Wing Gordon tells us of his boyhood,
his work-life, his love-life, his “jamborees.” Vividly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
written passages interpret the experiences. There is
no gainsaying the thorough grasp of the material, nor
the picaresque fascination of its handling. The book
is so crammed with folk-sayings and blues, however,
that it seems “made-up,” and both story and hero get
lost. Nevertheless, <i>Rainbow Round My Shoulder</i> is
a valuable case study, done without flattery or concern
for delicate feelings, white or black, humorous
without being minstrel, tragic without being sentimentalized.
And Left Wing Gordon is one of the best
folk-characters of recent realism.</p>

<p><i>Wings On My Feet</i> (1929) takes Left Wing overseas
in the World War. It is told in the same racy
idiom, as authentic as thorough investigation can make
it. One of the few treatments of the Negro in the
war, it is valuable for what it shows of a stevedore’s
reaction to Armageddon. It is a compound of humor,
pathos, and tragedy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Me an’ war same thing. Want me to fight; I been doing it all
my life.... White buddies mighty funny, too, sometimes. Sometimes
we sorry for ’em, sometimes we jes’ have to laugh at ’em.
Sometimes we don’t keer if some white boys, meaner’n devil, have
hard time, Lawd, we don’t keer, Lawd we don’t keer. Been
treatin’ us wrong, been hard on colored soldiers. White man
been fightin’ colored man. Now fightin’ selves.... Boys laugh
at’ em cause didn’t want salute officers. Colored soldiers salutin’
all time.... Maybe war got him, didn’t get me. He’s big captain
an’ I’m high private in rear rank, but I gets there just the
same.... Buddy so worried in mind. Germans got him, blowed
him clean to pieces. Wa’n’t necessary for him to go but nobody
couldn’t tell him nothin’. He wus gonna save little child. And
so he gave his life for little French child. Made me sad an’ I
kept hollerin’, “Say, Buddy, is you hurt, is you killed?” Knowed
he wus but jes’ kept hollerin to him....</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cold Blue Moon</i> (1931) is the last and least of this
trilogy dealing with Left Wing Gordon. In this book
the hero is among the stable boys in a shed, telling
ghost stories. When his turn comes, he launches, great
tale-teller that he is, into a series of legends on the
Old South. Some of them dispute the plantation tradition,
but in the main they run true to what Odum has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
called the Grandeur that Was, and the Glory that
Was Not. Left Wing is not at his best in these: he
is too far from the center of the picture.</p>

<p>One of the best twentieth century examples of the
Uncle Remus tradition is John B. Sales’ <i>The Tree
Named John</i> (1929), a collection of Mississippi folk-lore
in authentic dialect. Aunt Betsey plants an elm
tree—a quick budder, a fast grower and tough—as a
name tree for the grandchild of Ole Miss. Then she
presides over his upbringing, giving him lessons in folk-cures,
nature study and in “spe’ence” (“whut you gits
w’en you won’t larn by lis’enin to whut de old folks
tells you”). She and Aunt Polly and Uncle Alvord
tell him tales of animals of old days. One story,
“Ghos’es,” is a bitter story of a master who was kind
until he got drunk, when he became vicious. But <i>The
Tree Named John</i> stresses the affection between the
white family and its servants, and “the better and
gentler side of the Negro ... a phase of Negro life
which is fast being swallowed up in the ‘Harlem
movement.’”</p>

<p>In his <i>Juneteenth</i> (1932), J. Mason Brewer is likewise
concerned “about how unrepresentative of his
people in the South and Southwest the loudly-heralded
Negro literature of Harlem is—how false both in
psychology and language.” It is not clear why one
should expect the treatment of Harlem to be representative
of Brazos Bottom. One of the first collections
of old-time tales by a Negro, <i>Juneteenth</i> is generally
amusing. In a few tales the tables are turned on old
“Massa,” but there are none so harsh as Sales’
“Ghos’es” or the memories of slavery found in E. C.
L. Adams. A few good additions to the Brer Rabbit
cycle, and some interesting folk-tales called “White
Man’s Nigger: I,” “White Man’s Nigger: II,” “The
Tale of the Stud Nigger” and “Railroad Bill” are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
included in Carl Carmer’s <i>Stars Fell on Alabama</i>
(1934) which, true to its title, concentrates upon the
strange and mysterious. Vincent McHugh’s <i>Caleb
Catlum’s America</i> (1937) brings Uncle Remus and
John Henry together with American folk-heroes in a
fine yarn.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> Whether sociological realism or folklore
or partaking of both, the books considered in this
chapter have been marked by a close and often sympathetic
study of the Negro. Even in the case of
Bradford’s comics and Julia Peterkin’s exotics, authenticity
has been carefully sought. This regard for
realism, even when incomplete, has meant the discarding
of traditional estimates. Occasionally as in
Wood and Heyward, and especially in Adams, concern
for complete truth has resulted in the recording
of tragedies which no Negro folk group, however
isolated, has been so fortunate as to escape. With
new information and insight these authors have
brought the Negro into the mainstream of American
realism.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c9">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">THE URBAN SCENE</p>


<p><i>The Harlem School.</i>—Before 1925 there was
little in American fiction about Negro life in northern
cities. But when “the peasant moved cityward” in
the great sweeps of migration, books about the urban
Negro multiplied. The numbers of Negroes in northern
cities grew by leaps and bounds from 1916 on.
Although various cities beckoned—Pittsburgh with
its steelmills, Chicago with its stockyards, Detroit
with its automobile factories—it was Harlem that
became the Mecca for the southern Negro, the West
Indian, and the African. One historian of Harlem
states that it contains more Negroes to the square
mile than any other spot on earth. Harlem became
a Mecca likewise for white pleasure seekers from
downtown and abroad, who, hunting the new thrill
with the desperate eagerness of the post-war generation,
rushed to what they considered a place of primitive
abandon, of unfailing “joy of life.” Cabarets
sprang up like mushrooms; putting on a big time became
a major industry. In revolt against Victorian
prudishness and repression, and machine-age standardization,
writers and artists escaped to dark Harlem
for vicarious joy, and discovered an “exotic, savage
world,” only a nickel’s subway ride from the heart of
an over-civilized city. The Harlem Boom was useful
to Negro writers, who were influenced by the growing
race-consciousness of the “greatest Negro city in the
world.” Some accepted the downtown version of
pagan Harlem as gospel, others put in disclaimers, but
all made eager contact with the literary world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Carl Van Vechten’s <i>Nigger Heaven</i> (1925) was
the first novel to exploit this newly discovered territory,
and has remained the most influential. The
author, already known for sophisticated fiction, was
attracted by the high spirits and piquant contrasts of
Harlem. Running through the descriptions of cabarets,
wild parties, and sensational orgies is the story
of Byron, an “intellectual” wastrel. He is loved by
Mary, a girl superior to the fast set, but he cannot
resist the wiles of Lasca, “a gorgeous brown Messalina
of Seventh Avenue.” Byron’s character cracks under
the strain of fast living. His last gesture is one of
typical futility: in a fit of jealous and drunken rage,
he empties his gun into the body of his rival, who was
already dead, while the police approach.</p>

<p><i>Nigger Heaven</i> presented a setting and type of life
that were little known to American fiction except for
<i>The Autobiography of An Ex-Colored Man</i>. The
gin-mills and cabarets, the kept men and loose ladies of
Harlem’s bohemian fringe, have surface accuracy and
the appeal of the unfamiliar. Van Vechten in a short
space of time observed closely. But like a discoverer,
he was partial to exotic singularities. That these
exist does not validate the claim of the publishers that
“Herein is caught the fascination and tortured
ecstasies of Harlem.... The author tells the story of
modern Negro life.” Modern Negro life is not in
<i>Nigger Heaven</i>; certain selected scenes to prove
Negro primitivism are.</p>

<p>Claude McKay’s <i>Home To Harlem</i> (1926) has for
its setting the speak-easies, buffet flats and “tonsorial
parlors” of a pagan Harlem. The characters are
longshoremen, dining car cooks and waiters, and members
of sporting circles. Casual love affairs are their
main pursuits. Jake, an ex-soldier, recently returned
from the World War, meets and loses a marvelous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
brown charmer on his first night in Harlem. His
picaresque adventures and those of his cronies take up
the rest of the book, until he finds the long-lost beauty
at the end. Working conditions on the railroad are
described with some grimness, but <i>Home To Harlem</i>
lacks McKay’s sharpest protest. McKay’s nearest
approach to his poetry is in the ecstatic worship with
which Jake looks upon the abandon of the gay Mecca.</p>

<p>McKay’s <i>Banjo</i> (1929) is related to the Harlem
school of fiction, describing the life of stevedores,
tramps, sailors and panhandlers in the “Ditch” at
Marseilles. Ray, a vagabond intellectual from <i>Home
To Harlem</i>, does much of the talking; savoring color,
joy and beauty wherever he finds it, he is attracted to
the primitive and violent longshoremen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Educated Negroes ashamed of their race’s intuitive love of color
... ashamed of Congo-sounding laughter, ashamed of their complexion
(bleaching out), ashamed of their strong appetites. No
being ashamed for Ray. Rather than lose his soul, let intellect go
to hell and live instinct!</p>
</div>

<p>To Ray, “A black man, even though educated, was in
closer biological kinship to the swell of primitive earth
life.” Anti-bourgeois and anti-imperialist, seeing the
“civilized world” from the bottom, Ray is nevertheless
a racialist, not a radical. And such, in <i>Banjo</i>, is the
author’s position. He has been praised for dealing
with the proletariat, but the beachcombers here can
hardly be so considered. It is hard to see how reliance
upon instinct will improve the lot of the submerged
and the defeated.</p>

<p>The Harlem stories in <i>Gingertown</i> (1932) return
us to blues singers, “sweet backs,” entertainers, longshoremen,
railroad men, barbers, chambermaids, bellhops,
waiters and beautiful “brownskins.” All of
these are called by McKay the “joy-lovers” of the belt,
but their stories do not reveal great joy. In “Brownskin
Blues” and “Mattie and Her Sweetman” McKay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
bitterly scores color prejudice among Negroes themselves;
in “Highball” he scores prejudice among the
whites. “Near-White” tells conventionally of the
unhappy “passer.” In “Truant,” a dining car waiter,
married to a social climber, throws up his menial job
like a Sherwood Anderson hero. The stories are done
with unabashed realism, but they do not cover a wide
range.</p>

<p>McKay’s stories of his native Jamaica in <i>Gingertown</i>
and his third novel <i>Banana Bottom</i> (1933),
though realistic, have a pastoral quality. A setting
and way of life are skillfully and affectionately conveyed
in both books and we are spared preachments
on “the problem.” In <i>Banana Bottom</i> especially,
character development is uppermost. The story of
Bita Plant, educated in England, is simple and winning.
Minor characters like Squire Gensir, Jubban, Anty
Nommy and Crazy Bow are memorable, not idealized,
but emerging with dignity and warm flesh-and-blood
humanity.</p>

<p>Although these are perhaps McKay’s best fiction,
the greater part of his work deals with American
Negroes, particularly in Harlem. McKay has denied
that he was influenced by Van Vechten, stating that
<i>Home To Harlem</i> was about completed before <i>Nigger
Heaven</i> was published. There are points of agreement,
however; McKay, like Van Vechten, believes
in “the inexpressible exuberance and legendary vitality
of the black race,” and therefore seeks in the main
the colorful aspects of “the joy-belt.” There are
differences as well. Having worked as dining car
waiter, porter and longshoreman, McKay knew the
unskilled Negro worker at first hand, not from an
outside view. “I created my Negro characters without
sandpaper and varnish.” Because of this, his
people are not the quaint, artless innocents endeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to so many authors and readers. They live hard lives,
and are consequently hardened: they may be ignorant,
but they are not naïve. In dealing with the urban
worker, McKay opened a new field. But the Harlem
he portrayed still seems too close to the Harlem of a
popular literary fashion. And the “inner lives” he
knows so well have not yet been shown with the depth
of understanding that one might expect of Claude
McKay.</p>

<p>Rudolph Fisher portrays Harlem with a jaunty
realism. <i>The Walls of Jericho</i> deals with types as
different as piano-movers and “race-leaders.” The
antics of Jinx and Bubber are first-rate slapstick, and
though traces of Octavus Roy Cohen appear, most of
the comedy is close to Harlem side-walks. Fisher is
likewise master of irony. Miss Cramp, the philanthropist,
who believes that mulattoes are the result of the
American climate, is caricatured, but the picture of
the Annual Costume Ball of the G.I.A. (General
Improvement Association) is rich comedy of manners.
He deftly ridicules the thrill-seekers from downtown
who find everything in Harlem “simply marvelous.”
Satiric toward professional uplifters, <i>The Walls of
Jericho</i> still has the New Negro militancy. Merrit is
an embittered “New Negro”; he believes that the
Negro should let the Nordic do the serious things,
and spend his time in “tropic nonchalance, developing
nothing but his capacity for enjoyment,” and then take
complete possession through force of numbers. Fisher
likewise shows the spirit of racial unity between the
“dicties” and the masses—“Fays don’ see no difference
’tween dickty shines and any other kind o’ shines. One
jig in danger is ev’y jig in danger.” It is significant,
however, that the wrecking of a Negro’s house in a
white neighborhood is the work of a disgruntled
Negro, the villain of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>But Fisher was less interested in the “problem” than
in the life and language of Harlem’s poolrooms, cafes,
and barber shops. <i>The Conjure Man Dies</i> (1932),
the first detective novel by a Negro, brings Jinx and
Bubber back to the scene to help solve one of Harlem’s
grisliest murders. A high-brow detective, an efficient
Negro police sergeant and an erudite doctor of voodoo
are interesting new characters. The novel is above
the average in its popular field and was followed by a
Harlem tenement murder mystery solved by the same
detective.</p>

<p>Before his untimely death, Fisher became one of the
best short story writers of the New Negro movement.
“The City of Refuge,” containing a good description
of the southern migrant’s happy amazement at Harlem,
and “Blades of Steel” are first-rate local color of
the barber shops, dance-halls and cafes. “Vestiges”
and “Miss Cynthie,” for all of their light touch, have
an unusual tenderness and fidelity to middle class experience.
Fisher was an observer with a quick eye
and a keen ear, and a witty commentator. At times
his plots are too neat, with something of O. Henry’s
trickery. His Harlem is less bitter than McKay’s, but
it exists; and his realism, as far as it goes, is as definite
as that of any of the numerous writers who took
Harlem for their province.</p>

<p>In Countee Cullen’s <i>One Way To Heaven</i> (1932),
Sam Lucas, a one-armed gambler and vagabond, practices
a racket around the churches, pretending to be
saved at revivals and thereby collecting money. His
testimony in a Harlem church converts Mattie, who
falls in love with him. Alternately vicious and sentimental,
Sam makes Mattie’s life miserable until his
pretended death-bed vision of salvation brings happiness
to the religious girl. Mattie’s working for
Constancia Brown, an upper-class Negro, serves as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
excuse to bring in the artistic-bohemian Harlem.
Cullen’s pictures of this set are almost cartoons. He
lampoons the back-to-Africa movement, the philistines
who form Book-Lovers’ Societies, the public reciters
and the extreme New Negro racialists. But Constancia,
who refuses to “pass,” speaks the New Negro
creed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Enjoyment isn’t across the line. Money is there, and privilege,
and the sort of power which comes with numbers but as for enjoyment,
they don’t know what it is.... I have seen two Negroes
turn more than one dull party, where I was longing for home and
Harlem, into a revel which Puck himself would find it hard to
duplicate.</p>
</div>

<p>The best part of the novel is the portrayal of the
Negro church. This is fresher material, presented
with understanding.</p>

<p><i>Purpose Novels.</i> More realistic than his earlier
fiction, <i>Dark Princess</i> (1928) by W. E. B. DuBois, is
still part fantasy, and part mordant social criticism.
As editor of the <i>Crisis</i>, DuBois had urged a union of
the darker races of the world. <i>Dark Princess</i> is an
allegory driving home the same message. In its last
chapter Matthew Towns, the Negro hero, flies to his
homeplace in rural Virginia where his wife, Kautilya,
Her Royal Highness of Bwodpur, India, has just given
birth to a son, Matthew or Madhu. The son is
acclaimed “King of the Snows of Gaurisaukar, Grand
Mughal of Utter India, Messenger and Messiah to
all the Darker Worlds!” Kautilya explains:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There had to be a Maharajah in Bwodpur of the blood royal;
else brown reaction and white intrigue had made of it a footstool
of England. If I had not borne your son ... Bwodpur and
Sindrabad, India, and all the Darker World [would have been
lost.]</p>
</div>

<p>Less fantastic are the sections dealing with America,
in which Matthew Towns meets with galling insults,
lack of opportunity on every hand, and the smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
chicanery of Negro politicians. Two interesting characters
are Perigua, a Negro anarchist, and Sara, a
striving Negro woman, who plays the political game.
There are plots and counterplots in the manner of
E. Phillips Oppenheim. DuBois speaks of the novel
as “rich and colored gossamer of a dream which the
Queen of Faerie lent to me for a season.” But the
fusion of dream and social realism is not achieved;
the novel falls between the two.</p>

<p>A prominent figure in the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, Walter White
has made use of the novel for social protest. <i>The Fire
In The Flint</i> (1925) tells the tragedy of a better-class,
aspiring Negro family in a Georgia town. Bob Harper
kills two white men who raped his sister. Tracked
down by a lynching mob, he shoots himself with his
last bullet. His brother Kenneth, a promising young
physician, is lynched in the ensuing hysteria for “assaulting
a white woman” whom he had been called in
to attend. <i>The Fire In The Flint</i> contains sardonic
comment upon the backwardness of the South. The
millhands of Factoryville have only “one strong conviction—the
inherent and carefully nurtured hatred of
the ‘nigger’.” Like the earlier apologists, White makes
use of well educated heroes, avoids dialect in the main,
concentrates the injustices of the South into fairly
small compass, and has bitter contempt for the
“cracker” and the Klan. But <i>The Fire In The Flint</i>
has more of an impact than the earlier books on
lynching.</p>

<p>Although Walter White’s <i>Flight</i> (1926) describes
the Atlanta riot, it is principally a novel about “passing.”
Mimi Daquin, a New Orleans octoroon of distinguished
lineage, has an unfortunate love affair with
an upper class Negro in Atlanta, and goes to the
North. Seeking security for her child she marries a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
white broker, but remains essentially unhappy. Her
husband has no love for Negroes. Even as a child,
Mimi had believed that Creoles of Negro blood had
something “tangible, yet intangible ... a warmth, a
delicate humanness” that white Creoles did not have.
As a woman, she believes that Negroes alone “can
laugh and ... enjoy the benefits of the machine without
being crushed by it.” A furtive trip to Harlem makes
her wonder if her somber cynical white companions,
“whose unhappiness shone through all they did or
said,” were worth the price she was paying. When
she hears a great Negro artist singing spirituals, she
is set free, and returns to her own.</p>

<p><i>Bourgeois Realism.</i>—Continuing the earlier apologist
tradition, with propaganda a little less direct,
certain novelists have set out to prove the presence of
a Negro upper-class, and to deplore the injustices of
its lot. Their standards are bourgeois; they respect
characters in ratio to their color, breeding, gentility,
wealth and prestige. “Realism” is perhaps a misnomer,
if these novels are judged by their plots, which
are seldom very life-like; the realism is chiefly in the
settings.</p>

<p>Gertrude Sanborn’s <i>Veiled Aristocrats</i> (1923) reveals
the type. The “aristocrats under the veil” are
mulatto descendants of southern aristocrats—“the
souls of worthy men and women caught by a mad fate
in a prison of prejudice!” A sentimental white youth
is brought into contact with these fine people, especially
with Carr McClellan, a World War hero, and a great
sculptor. Carr is beloved by the beautiful daughter
of a white financier. At the right time she is revealed
to be colored too, another “veiled aristocrat,” so
everything ends happily. There are many incredible
coincidences. Though well-meaning, the author is
still condescending. Her protest concludes lamely:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
“Fact of the matter, most of us are not giving our
colored brothers a square deal.”</p>

<p>Zona Gale, introducing Jessie Fauset’s third novel,
states inaccurately: “Wherever the American Negro
has appeared in fiction, only the uneducated Negro
has been pictured.” She is on surer ground when she
writes that Negroes of education and substance “merit
the awareness of their fellow countrymen.” In her
own foreword, Jessie Fauset reveals her bent to “the
colored American who is not pressed too hard by the
Furies of Prejudice, Ignorance, and Economic Injustice,”
and who has his own caste lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As naturally as his white compatriot he speaks of his “old
Boston families,” “old Philadelphians,” “old Charlestonians.” And
he has a wholesome respect for family and education and labor
and the fruits of labor ... sufficiently conservative to lay a
slightly greater stress on the first two of these four.</p>
</div>

<p><i>There Is Confusion</i> (1924) has as central characters
Joanna Marshall, an ambitious dancer, whose
“success and fame were instant,” and Peter Bye, a
brilliant, sensitive medical student. The home-life of
middle-class Philadelphia receives some attention, but
the love story receives far more. The “problem” is
never far off. In a pageant, Joanna represents
America. Forced by great applause to unmask, she
speaks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I hardly need tell you that there is no one in the audience more
American than I am. My great grandfather fought in the Revolution,
my uncle fought in the Civil War, and my brother is ‘over
there’ now.</p>
</div>

<p>Joanna refuses to marry a Negro whom she found
“charming and sympathetic ... [but] too white. She
did not want a marriage which would keep the
difficulties of color more than ever before her eyes.”
<i>Plum Bun</i> (1929) is greatly concerned with “passing.”
Believing that “the great rewards of life—riches,
glamour, pleasure—are for white-skinned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
people only,” Angela goes “over the line.” After a
disillusioning liaison with a rich white man, “which
left no trace on her moral nature,” she falls in love
with Anthony Cross, and fears to reveal her secret.
But love will find a way: he reveals that he too is of
Negro parentage, “passing” because his father was
lynched by a mob. So now they can marry, as in
<i>Veiled Aristocrats</i>. The beautiful brown sister, for
whom life has been evenly pleasant, likewise marries
happily at the book’s end.</p>

<p><i>The Chinaberry Tree</i> (1931) is again concerned
less with the unspectacular drama of the Negro middle
class, than with the melodrama of the octoroon. The
two heroines are illegitimate. Laurentine is the
daughter of Aunt Sal and Colonel Halloway, who
loved Sal devotedly but could not marry her. In contrast
to Laurentine’s love affair, there is a great deal
of confusion in the life of Melissa, who is saved only
in the nick of time from marrying her half-brother.
There are valuable glimpses of Negro community life
in Red Brook, the characters ranging from Mrs.
Ismay, a Bostonian of “innate gentility,” to young
pool-room sports. But the complications springing
from the “mystery of birth” make what could have
been realism into old-fashioned romance. Olivia Cary,
who dominates <i>Comedy, American Style</i> (1933) is
obsessed by the need to be white, not out of shame for
her blood, but because of the things which the white
world possesses. She persecutes her husband and
drives her daughter into a loveless marriage and her
son to suicide. The bitter comedy of race-prejudice
is ultimately blamed. With random flashes of power,
<i>Comedy, American Style</i> is without satiric drive, and
manages to be sentimental instead of tragic.</p>

<p>Jessie Fauset has been called by one critic the American
woman most worthy “to wear the mantle of Jane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Austen’s genius.” This comparison is not apt: Jane
Austen’s satiric approach to her people and setting and
her neatly logical plots are not evident in Miss Fauset’s
four novels. Miss Fauset is sentimental, and regardless
of her disclaimers, is an apologist. She records
a class in order to praise a race. Favorite characters
are chauvinists, condemning “the dastardly American
whites,” believing that Negro blood is “the leaven that
will purify this Nordic people of their cruelty and
their savage lust of power.” Having courageously set
herself to chart the class of Negroes she knows, Jessie
Fauset, at her best, succeeds in a realism of the sort
sponsored by William Dean Howells. Too often, however,
instead of typical Negro middle class experience
we get the more spectacular “passing,” and exceptional
Negro artists and cosmopolitans. Miss Fauset has
written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To be a Negro in America posits a dramatic situation. The
elements of the play fall together involuntarily; they are just
waiting for Fate the producer to quicken them into movement,—for
Chance the Prompter to interpret them with fidelity.</p>
</div>

<p>But her novels rely too much upon Fate and Chance.</p>

<p><i>The Tragic Mulatto Passes For White.</i> Nella
Larsen’s <i>Quicksand</i> (1928) covers a great deal of
ground, from Georgia to Chicago, Harlem, Copenhagen,
and finally a small southern town. Upper class
Negroes are her main characters, and their snobbishness
is revealed (both consciously and unconsciously).
Helga Crane is buffeted about, but does not attain
tragic stature. The attempt to reveal a self-centred,
harassed personality is commendable, but is not helped
by scenes like the one in which the sophisticated
heroine attends a church meeting, and there, overwhelmed
by the frenzy, begins to yell like one insane,
and to weep torrents of tears. She felt “a supreme
aspiration toward the regaining of simple happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
... unburdened by the complexities of the lives she had
known.” In <i>Passing</i> (1930) Mrs. Larsen is anxious
to set before us the refinement and good taste of
wealthier Negroes. Clare, who “passes,” is unhappy,
and frequently visits Harlem. “You don’t realize, you
can’t realize how I want to see Negroes, to be with
them again, to talk with them, to hear them laugh.”
Says the author’s spokesman, “they always come back.”
Discovered in Harlem by her Negro-hating husband,
Clare falls from a sixth story window—death solves
her problems. Her friend, Irene, who would not
“pass,” lives in contrast a happy, respectable life.</p>

<p>White novelists rushed into print with a different
version. Vara Caspary’s <i>The White Girl</i> (1929) and
Geoffrey Barnes’ <i>Dark Lustre</i> (1932) are so alike in
essentials that they should be considered together.
Both of the heroines are repelled by Negro life and
Negro suitors. Both because of their exotic beauty
become artistic models, and both have tragic love
affairs with white men. In <i>The White Girl</i>, Solaria’s
secret is revealed by the coincidental appearance of her
brown-skinned brother. Desperate, and believing that
she is growing darker, she drinks poison. In <i>Dark
Lustre</i> Aline’s dilemma is solved by having her die in
childbirth, but her whiter baby lives to continue “a
cycle of pain.” Both books advance the old superstitions.
Solaria at a wild party is thus explained: “It
was the colored blood in her, the heritage from some
forgotten ancestor, that released these warm wild
winds of passion.” Aline is thus explained: “There
was too much nigger in her to follow a line of reasoning
when the black cloud of her emotions settled over
it.” It is all so sad.</p>

<p>Hallie Dickerman’s <i>Stephen Kent</i> (1935), on the
other hand, takes up the cudgel for her mulatto hero’s
superiority, but he is made too superior, winning prizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and acting nobly at every turn. There is much mystery
about “tainted blood,” about the reappearance of
colored blood “unto the third and fourth generations.”
A sympathetic plea for justice, <i>Stephen Kent</i> is still
hard to credit. <i>Imitation of Life</i> (1933) by Fannie
Hurst was well meaning, perhaps, but it, too, perpetuated
old stereotypes. Peola longs to be white:
“I won’t be a nigger! I won’t be a nigger!” Her black
mother is philosophical about it: “It may be mixed up
wid plenty of white blood ... but thin out chicken
gravy wid water an’ it remains chicken gravy, only
not so good.” When Peola meets with problems:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lord git de white horses drove out of her blood. Kill de curse—shame
de curse her light-colored pap lef’ for his baby. Chase
it, rabbit’s foot. Chase de wild white horses trampin’ on my
chile’s happiness.... It’s de white horses dat’s wild, a-swimmin’
in de blood of mah chile....</p>
</div>

<p>It is no wonder that, longing to be stable, Peola
“passes” and marries on the other side. Delilah, with
a “rambunctious capacity for devotion,” is the old
contented slave, brought up to date, worshipful of her
white Miss Honey Bea, to whom her drudgery has
brought wealth. The statement is clear: black Negroes,
contented with serving and worshipping whites;
mixed Negroes, discontented, aspiring, and therefore
tragic. Alas, the poor mulatto!</p>

<p>We have thus seen that the mulatto who “passes”
has been a victim of opposing interpretations. Negro
novelists urge his unhappiness, until he is summoned
back to his people by the spirituals, or their full-throated
laughter, or their simple sweet ways. One
of Wallace Thurman’s characters says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear, you’ve been reading novels. Thousands of Negroes
cross the line and I assure you that few, if any, feel that fictional
urge to rejoin their own kind.... Negroes who can and do pass
are so glad to get away they probably join the K.K.K. to uphold
white supremacy.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>
<p>But this is heresy: a mystical bond must be shown, the
cutting of which produces grief, since the white world
is “pallid and to be pitied.”</p>

<p>White novelists insist upon the mulatto’s unhappiness
for other reasons. To them he is the anguished
victim of a divided inheritance. Mathematically they
work it out that his intellectual strivings and self-control
come from his white blood, and his emotional urgings,
indolence and potential savagery come from his
Negro blood. Their favorite character, the octoroon,
wretched because of the “single drop of midnight in
her veins,” desires a white lover above all else, and
must therefore go down to a tragic end. The white
version is nearly a century old; the Negro version
sprang up recently. Both are examples of race flattery.
Divided between conflicting attitudes, the poor mulatto
finds added unhappiness in his interpreters.</p>

<p><i>In Opposition.</i> But the idealism seen in the apologistic,
the bourgeois, and the “passing” novels found
a gleeful critic in George Schuyler, of the H. L.
Mencken school of satirists. <i>Black No More</i> (1931)
tells how Dr. Crookman discovers a drug that will turn
Negroes white. Negroes rush to use it, even the
chauvinists who had preached pride of race. Schuyler
lampoons both sides, the professional “race-men” who
were tremendous gainers from the “problem,” and the
spokesman of the Knights of Nordica who, though
totally ignorant, discussed over the radio “anthropology,
psychology, miscegenation, cooperation with
Christ, getting right with God, and curbing Bolshevism....”
Telling blows are landed on statisticians,
rhetorical windbags, pretentious strivers and hat-in-hand
Negroes, but <i>Black No More</i> is farce rather than
satire, in the last analysis—provoking more mirth
than thought. It was, however, refreshingly different.
<i>Slaves Today</i> (1932) is an attack upon the mistreatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of the natives in Liberia by the upper-class
Americo-Liberians. Schuyler’s narrative sketches in
such magazines as <i>The American Mercury</i> are told
with terseness and point.</p>

<p>Wallace Thurman is likewise the “devil’s advocate”
in his two novels. Emma Lou in <i>The Blacker The
Berry</i> (1929) is another defeated heroine, not because
she is an octoroon, however, but for precisely the
opposite reason. Well-educated, she is unable to get
suitable positions and social life because she is black.
She goes around for a time with the “New Negro
intellectuals,” but is ill at ease with them. Scorned
and rejected, she sinks deeper and deeper into drabness.
Thurman thus puts his finger upon one of the
sorest points of the Negro bourgeoisie, its color snobbishness,
“its blue vein circle,” “aspiring to be whiter
and whiter every generation.” His descriptions of
Harlem rent parties and the like are of Van Vechten’s
school, but the theme of his novel deserves attention.
Unfortunately the writing is slipshod, and the steady
decline of his central character is less tragic than depressing.
His heroine is as morbidly sensitive about
color as any tragic octoroon, and shows as little fight.</p>

<p><i>The Infants of The Spring</i> (1932) shows Thurman
taking less seriously his coterie of Harlem artists.
Young in years and achievement, they flatter themselves
as “a lost generation,” and like Van Vechten’s
Byron, seek escape in dissipation. One cynical character
speaks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Being a Negro writer in these days is a racket and I’m going
to make the most of it while it lasts. I find queer places for
whites to go in Harlem ... out-of-the-way primitive churches,
side street speakeasies and they fall for it. About twice a year I
manage to sell a story.... I am a genius in the making. Thank
God for this Negro Literary Renaissance! Long may it flourish!</p>
</div>

<p>Debunking the Bohemian futility of the intellectuals,
Thurman is just as severe on the bourgeois idealists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and the various race-messiahs. <i>Infants of The Spring</i>
is at times peevish, at times angry, crudely written, and
not always well thought out. But like Thurman’s first
novel, it had something to say.</p>

<p><i>Black Sadie</i> (1928) by T. Bowyer Campbell is an
irritated southerner’s attempt to debunk the Harlem
that lured jaded Bohemians. From “corn-field nigger”
Sadie rises to be model for the New Negro exaltation
of <i>Africa victrix</i>, and the toast of artistic New York.
Even in her affluence, however, Sadie is a kleptomaniac.
After causing a murder, she returns to happy Virginia.
“Easy come, easy go, niggers” are Campbell’s closing
words. Campbell’s satire has point, but he is too
vexed to get it across. It is obvious, also, that the
stereotype he prefers is that of the comic menial.</p>

<p><i>Dark Surrender</i> by Ronald Kirkbride (1933), after
describing South Carolina plantation life in the manner
of Julia Peterkin, delivers an attack upon the
“New Negro.” Having deserted a wife on the plantation,
who promptly becomes a Scarlet Sister Mary,
Tom goes to the North, graduates from Harvard with
athletic and scholastic honors, visits Europe, and becomes
a great poet. But he gives it all up as “imitation
of the accomplishments of the white man,” and
returns to the soil. To the white owner of the plantation
he states that Negroes</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>who have aspirations and yearn to be great ... are fools in the
sense that they are not true negroes.... To live from day to day
in simple enjoyment, with no cares nor worries, with no great attempts,
to be something which you are not ... that is life, the
true life.... The negro has his place in the present, in the
simple life, with no desires but of the body, with no yearnings for
the future nor for the past....</p>
</div>

<p>Maxwell Bodenheim, with a naturalist’s approach,
could not see in Harlem only a place of joy-filled
Negroes. In <i>Naked On Roller Skates</i> (1931) he
shows the harsher, truculent aspects of Harlem dives.
In <i>Ninth Avenue</i> (1926) he shows the seamy aspects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of Manhattan. His white heroine in this book marries
a Negro, a better man than any of the Ninth
Avenue set. Contrary to O’Neill’s <i>All God’s Chillun
Got Wings</i> this intermarriage is not doomed to failure.
In <i>Deep River</i> (1934) Clement Wood does not have
the regret, disdain, or anxiety with which most southern
novelists look upon Harlem and the “New Negro.”
This chronicle of the marriage of a noted Negro
singer to a white woman is frankly done, exploiting a
subject generally taboo. But it is hardly worthy to
stand alongside Wood’s earlier novel <i>Nigger</i>.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> The fiction of urban realism was valuable
for introducing new characters in a new milieu.
Whether created by Negro or white authors, the
characters are race-conscious, and at times militant.
But the old stereotypes by no means disappeared.
Carl Van Vechten has a noted magazine editor comment
on the possibilities of Negro literature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nobody has yet written a good gambling story; nobody has
gone into the curious subject of the divers tribes of the region....
Nobody has ever done the Negro servant-girl, who refuses to
live in. Washing dishes in the day-time, she returns at night to
Harlem where she smacks her daddy in the jaw or else dances
and makes love. On the whole I should say she has the best time
of any domestic servant in the world.... The Negro fast set
does everything the Long Island fast set does ... but it is vastly
more amusing ... for the simple reason that it is <i>amused</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Most authors took this to heart. What resulted was
a search for the exotic and an insistence that Negroes
were peculiarly marked by a “joy of living.” Dance-halls,
rent-parties, gambling, sprees, casual love-affairs
crowded out more serious realism. The cabin was
exchanged for the cabaret, but Negroes were still
described as “creatures of joy.” Even Negro propagandists
urged this, seeking to find some superior
“racial gift.” To look for the true life of a Negro
community in cabarets, most often run by white managers
for white thrill-seekers, is like looking for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
truth about slavery in the off-time banjo-plunking and
capers before the big house. Focusing upon carefree
abandon, the Harlem school, like the plantation tradition,
neglected the servitude. Except for brief
glimpses, the drama of the workaday life, the struggles,
the conflicts, are missing. And such definite features
of Harlem as the lines of the unemployed, the overcrowded
schools, the delinquent children headed
straight to petty crime, the surly resentment—all of
these seeds that bore such bitter fruit in the Harlem
riot—are conspicuously absent.</p>

<p>Bourgeois realists did “apprise white humanity of
the better classes among Negro humanity,” but this
is a value apart from the values of fiction. Their
upper-class characters too often seem to serve as
window-display. “Passing for white” is made a much
more acute and frequent problem that it is in ordinary
Negro middle class experience. With discerning satire,
Martha Gruening sums up the argument of Negro
bourgeois realism:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am writing this book because most white people still believe
that all Colored People are cooks called Mandy or Pullman porters
called George—but they aren’t. They think we all live in
cotton field cabins or in city slums, but actually some of us live
on Edgecomb Avenue or Chestnut Street. We don’t all shout at
Camp Meeting or even all belong to the Baptist or Methodist
church. Some of us are <i>Episcopalians</i>. If you were privileged
to visit our homes (which you aren’t, for we are just as exclusive
as you are) you would find bathtubs, sets of the best authors and
etchings! That’s how refined we are. We have class distinctions,
too.... The daughters of our upper classes are beautiful
and virtuous and look like illustrations in <i>Vogue</i> ... far more
attractive than white girls of the same class, for they come in
assorted shades.... Joy isn’t on your side of the line, nor song,
nor laughter.</p>
</div>

<p>There is certainly place in American fiction for
treatment of the Negro middle-class. The precarious
situation of this small group could well attract a
realist of vision, not only to satirize its pretense, but
also to record its dogged struggling. But to approve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
it in proportion to its resembling white middle-class
life, is not the way of important realism.</p>

</div>

<p class="c">SOUTHERN REALISM</p>


<p><i>Mystics and Poets.</i> In his <i>Notebook</i> (1926) Sherwood
Anderson tells of a Mississippian who showed
the ear of a lynched Negro as a symbol of “white
superiority.” Anderson seldom mentions such gruesome
facts of Negro experience; like Van Vechten
and Julia Peterkin he is attracted to the Negro’s elemental
exoticism. In “I Want To Know Why,” the
white hero is drawn to Negro jockeys, cooks and
stable boys; in <i>Dark Laughter</i> (1925) Anderson himself
is fascinated by the Negro’s superiority to dull,
standardized whites.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Niggers on the docks, niggers in the city streets, niggers laughing.
A slow dance is going on.... A brown woman having
thirteen children—a different man for every child—going to
church too, singing, dancing, broad shoulders, broad hips, soft
eyes, a soft laughing voice.... Negroes singing had sometimes a
way of getting at the ultimate truth of things.</p>
</div>

<p>This chorus of happy sensualists mocking repressed
whites may explain “ultimate truth” to Anderson, but
a great deal of truth about their lives escapes his penetrating
interest. Harassed by Puritanism and industrialism,
Anderson has found elements that bring him
peace, rather than interpretation of a people.</p>

<p>Waldo Frank looks upon <i>Holiday</i> (1923) as his
story of “one of the greatest of American dramas—the
struggle in the South between the white race and
the black ... <i>each of which ... needs what the other
possesses</i>.” Like his fellow mystic Anderson, Frank
sees Niggertown to be full of warm song and happy,
ironic laughter, free from the strain of money-making,
repressed White-town. But he likewise sees insult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
exploitation and struggle. “Chokin’ is de black man’s
life,” says one old woman, who knows the South too
well. The passive cruelty of White Nazareth is introduced
when a Negro deckhand drowns and no one
makes an effort to save him. We see the active cruelty
when John Cloud, ambitious and manly young Negro,
and Virginia, “weary of her whiteness,” of being incessantly
sheltered, step out from the pattern. In a
spell of drought and revivals, John and Virginia meet
by accident in the woods above Nazareth. Though
“boss-girl” and “servant-man,” they have been drawn
from mutual respect into desire. When Virginia returns
to Nazareth, the meeting is misunderstood, and
the men, already whipped up by religious hysteria,
quickly form a mob. Shocked from her dream of
escape, Virginia sinks back into southern conventionality
and half-remorseful inertia, and does not speak.
At dusk, John is burned in the Square of Nazareth.</p>

<p>Frank sees that White-town, assuring itself that the
“nigger will stay in his place,” is still forever suspicious
of “the muttering, the stirring.” More boldly than
others, Frank reveals what he considers the deepest
cause of much of the fear:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Good mo’nin ... I have been walkin’ by yo’ side all of this
street. An’ yo’ didn’t see me.’ He gives these words with a prophetic
dryness. John feels the ominous threat.... ‘<i>I’ve watched
you, nigger</i>,’ they say, ‘<i>I’ve watched you lookin’ at my daughter.
How dare you look at my daughter? Nigger, that look in yo’
eyes means murder in our land. How dare you nigger, look so
hard at my daughter that you forget to salute the white man at
yo’ side?</i>’</p>
</div>

<p>When Virginia, who knows how free her brother is
with Negro women, laughs at the “fanatical obsessions”
of her men-folk, she adds flame to the tinder.
Symbolic and difficult, <i>Holiday</i> is still a true, powerful
and different version of race relations in the South.
In <i>The Death and Birth of David Markand</i> (1933),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
however, the brief treatment of the Negro falls below
the penetration of <i>Holiday</i>.</p>

<p>Deriving in part from Anderson and Waldo Frank,
Jean Toomer’s <i>Cane</i> (1923) has much greater intimacy
with Negro life, dealing equally well with the
black belt of Georgia and bourgeois Washington.
Toomer is master of fluid, evocative prose; some of
his stories are prose-poems.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sun is hammered to a band of gold. Pine-needles, like
mazda, are brilliantly aglow. No rain has come to take the rustle
from the falling sweet-gum leaves. Over in the forest, across the
swamp, a sawmill blows its closing whistle. Smoke curls up....
Curls up and spreads itself pine-high above the branch, a single
silver band along the eastern valley. A black boy ... you are
the most sleepiest man I ever seed, Sleeping Beauty ... cradled
on a gray mule, guided by the hollow sound of cowbells, heads
for them through a rusty cotton field.</p>
</div>

<p>His faithfully portrayed Georgia landscape Toomer
has peopled with faithfully drawn characters, such as
Fern, the shiftless, ignorant beauty of the Georgia
Pike, and Becky, a white outcast, who bears two Negro
children. “Blood Burning Moon” tells of the rivalry
between a Negro and a white man for a Negro girl,
that ends in a murder and a lynching. Not propaganda
in the manner of the apologists, it is tragic realism at
its best.</p>

<p>Neither debunking Negro society nor glorifying it,
Toomer pictures Washington with the thoroughness
of one who knew it from the inside. The futile, and
in the story of “Avey,” the drably tragic revolt against
the smugness of a rising middle-class, are brilliantly
set before us. Toomer was sharply criticized by
Negroes for his “betrayal”; his insight and tenderness
seemed to escape them. “Kabnis” is a long, occasionally
obscure story of a northern Negro teaching school
in Georgia. No one has done so well as Toomer the
hypocritical school principal, a petty, puritanical tyrant
who truckles to the whites. Laymon, a preacher-teacher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
who “knows more than would be good for
anyone other than a silent man”; Halsey, a self-assured,
courageous artisan; and Kabnis, a weakling
idealist driven to cynicism and dissipation until he
discovers, mystically, the strength of his people, are
similarly well drawn. Toomer reveals in “Kabnis”
an insight that makes his failure to write a novel about
Negro life one of the undoubted losses of contemporary
literature.</p>

<p>In another brilliant first book, <i>Tropic Death</i>
(1926), Eric Walrond is as conversant with his
native West Indian life as Toomer was with that of
Georgia. Like Toomer he stressed the tragedy and
pain in his milieu rather than the joy-of-living stressed
by the Harlem school. Gifted with a power of description,
Walrond gives us, for the first time, a vivid
sense of Negro life in the tropics below the Gulf
stream.</p>

<p>All of the stories deal with death, which to these
peasants, sailors and workers does not come easily,
but violently, often horribly. One child, in the
droughts, eats marl; her stomach distended like “a
wind-filling balloon.” Another dies, poisoned by
<i>obeah</i>. Two “wharf rats” who dive for the coins flung
by bored tourists are killed by a shark. The approach
is unapologetically naturalistic; life in the tropics is
not pleasant to Walrond, and he has not idealized it.
He seems completely familiar with the divers West
Indian dialects and with his characters’ ways of life,
whether they are underpaid workers on the Big Ditch,
or truck gardeners in Barbadoes, or waiters and cooks
on the old vessels that plow the Spanish Main. “Subjection”
tells of the murder of a Negro laborer by a
marine, for interference when the marine was beating
a sick worker on a road-gang. With the exception of
this story, Walrond writes little of social protest. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
is sardonically aware of the way imperialism is made
to work, but his chief purpose is to make the reader
“see,” to give him sense impression of a unique, interesting
world. The prose of <i>Tropic Death</i> is sometimes
overwritten, sometimes too oblique for clarity. But
it revealed uncommon powers that, regrettably, Walrond
has not used further.</p>

<p>Langston Hughes’ first novel, <i>Not Without Laughter</i>
(1930), one of the best by a Negro author, is set
in a small Kansas town, a transplanted bit of the South.
Sandy’s mother, Annjee, works in the white-folks’
kitchen and his grandmother, Aunt Hager, takes in
washing so that Sandy shall have his chance, in spite
of his irresponsible father, Jimboy. A life poor in the
world’s goods is shown to be “not without laughter”:
there are great colored tent meetings, carnivals, barbecues,
dances, and guitar concerts by the beloved
vagabond Jimboy. At their best, however, these
enjoyments are poor reliefs from the day’s hard work
for the white-folks. Prejudice lies all around Sandy;
going to the carnival on Children’s Day, he is ordered
away with “I told you little darkies this wasn’t your
party.” For Sandy’s pretty, joyful Aunt Harriet, there
was nothing in Stanton after awhile but street-walking
to the great grief of old, tired Aunt Hager. Excepting
Aunt Tempy, who is sharply satirized as a high-toned
striver, all of the characters are treated with
sympathy. Here, done with poetic realism, is a good
novel of boyhood.</p>

<p><i>God Sends Sunday</i> (1931), the first novel of
another Negro poet, Arna Bontemps, deals with sporting
life at the turn of the century. Born on a Red
River plantation, little Augie, a lover of horses,
becomes a famous jockey in such racing towns as San
Antonio, New Orleans, Louisville, and St. Louis. At
the height of his fame he was “a treat to casual eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I’se gonna git me a two-gallon high-roller hat dat won’t do.
Gonna git me a box-back coat an’ a milk white ves’ wid red
roses painted on it.”... His high-roller had twenty naked women
worked in the eyelets in the crown. His shirts had two-inch
candy stripes of purple, pink, green or orange.... His shoes had
mirrors in the toes and dove-colored uppers with large pearl
buttons....</p>
</div>

<p>Women flocked to him, especially Della and Florence,
whom he loved “worse than a horse loves corn.” But
his luck turns, and Lil Augie says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I ain’t nobody. I ain’t nuthin. I’s jes a po picked sparrow.
I ain’t big as a dime, an’ I don’t worth a nickel.</p>
</div>

<p>With all his bravado and vanity, Lil Augie is courageous
as a bantam, always ready “to try anybody one
barrel.” <i>God Sends Sunday</i> is not pretentious, but it
is a well-done portrait of a winning character.</p>

<p><i>Against Southern Charm.</i> Three of the most intelligent
women of the southern literary renaissance have
had their say about the South’s vaunted charm. In
Elizabeth Madox Roberts’ <i>My Heart and My Flesh</i>
(1927) the heroine discovers that she is half-sister
to Stiggins, a Negro stable boy, who is the half-witted
butt of the town, and to two Negro women. Frustrated
and desperate, she turns more and more to
furtive companionship with her sullen half-sisters. The
incidental Negroes who work in boarding house
kitchens, or take in washing, or do the heavy manual
labor of the Kentucky town are far from the quaintly
funny folk of Irvin Cobb and Ruth McEnery Stuart.</p>

<p>A roughly similar situation appears in Isa Glenn’s
<i>A Short History of Julia</i> (1928), an incisive attack
upon the upper caste South. While Julia is being
brought up as a hot-house plant, her servant Cynthia
has a full and loose love-life. Both end up unhappily,
with nothing to look forward to. Patty, one of the
most believable mammies in fiction, brings up her white
charges most decorously, but neglects her attractive and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
rebellious daughter. Chivalry is summed up by Negro
characters as “white women jes’ lying and lying to
theirselves.” The aristocratic men-folk, old topers,
who, untrue to one “southern tradition,” often get
drunk, declaim that “a pure and virtuous lady is the
finest work of the Almighty.” But they keep Negro
mistresses, and, in their dotage, unlike the earlier
gentlemen, “forget to cover up.”</p>

<p>Emily Clark’s <i>Stuffed Peacocks</i> (1927) is affectionately
ironic toward the F. F. V’s. In “Chocolate
Sponge,” a servant calmly states that she is a lady,
because her grandfather was Colonel Ashton
Wycherly. Since Negroes did not usually mention such
facts, she is “frightfully uncomfortable to have
around.” In spite of the mask of servility, which the
cleverest house-servants “are careful never to let slip,”
there are others who produce discomfort. Mammy
Sally</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>had been separated, as a young woman, from her first husband,
whom she loved, and transplanted in another country.... Her
ancient eyes were inscrutable and not altogether pleasant when
she was questioned about it.</p>
</div>

<p>Similarly aloof, unconventional and forbidding are
two other mammies, who disdain both Negro hilarity
and white sentimentality. In “Fast Color,” a Negro
butler, almost a “stage darky,” kept his thoughts carefully
guarded. Knowing Negro servants in “their
dining-room work, the most gracious form of labor,”
Miss Clark likewise knows that “their swiftest and
simplest ways to impromptu gratuities” are not their
only ways.</p>

<p><i>Regionalism.</i> Less ambitious than the mystics and
less probing than the critics of southern caste, a number
of regionalists have followed the lead of DuBose
Heyward, Howard Odum and Julia Peterkin. Nearly
a decade ago a southern critic wrote that “the southerner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
has had to turn to the Negro when he wanted
to paint life as it is”; and although less pertinent today,
this partly explains the rush to describe the Negro.
Many had new stories to tell, and they told them honestly
and sincerely; many others offered twice-told
tales. Their coverage of the South is widespread, and
to follow them from Virginia to Louisiana is as good
a plan as any.</p>

<p>Pernet Patterson’s <i>The Road to Canaan</i> (1931), a
collection of eight stories, deals with Negro life in
Richmond and the nearby country. Some are farcical,
as the story where a visiting anthropologist, seeking
to measure heads, spreads terror; some are pathetic.
“Conjur” is a good tale of black magic; “Shoofly,”
one the best, re-creates life in a tobacco factory; and
“Buttin’ Blood” tells convincingly of the friendship of
white and Negro boys. With no social protest and
more than a trace of condescension, often engineered
to end happily, Patterson’s stories still show understanding.</p>

<p>Paul Green’s few sketches of Negroes in <i>Wide
Fields</i> (1928) do not have the power of his plays
of Negro life, but they are sympathetic and true.
There is bitterness in the stories of Arthur Loring,
humble and hardworking “synonym for what the
white folks thought Negroes ought to be,” and of
Lalie Fowler, the mother of a child by a white farmer.
Hardworking tenant farmers, “flash” sports and bad
men are convincingly shown in this book as well as in
Green’s novel <i>The Body of This Earth</i> (1935). It
is significant that Green made over a story of poor-whites
into a Negro farce, <i>The Man Who Died At
Twelve O’clock</i>, with hardly any changes in idiom,
characterization, and incident. A different Carolina
locale and type of life are in R. H. Harriss’ <i>The
Foxes</i> (1936), a good hunting novel which includes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
well described Negro stable-boys, dog trainers, and old
servants.</p>

<p><i>South Carolina.</i> A new locale of South Carolina
and a new type of people are discovered in <i>Po’ Buckra</i>
(1930) by Gertrude Shelby and Samuel Stoney, the
authors of <i>Black Genesis</i>. In a community of quality
white folks, “crackers,” Negroes and “Brass-Ankles,”
Barty attempts to rise out of the last despised group,
a mixture of Portuguese-Indian-Negro and American
white stocks. But suspicion and gossip dog him about,
and he becomes a drunkard and murderer. Minor
Negro characters are well handled.</p>

<p>But where the authors of <i>Po’ Buckra</i> stand on their
own feet, Mrs. L. M. Alexander in <i>Candy</i> (1934)
seems to lean heavily upon Julia Peterkin. Trouble
visits only rarely the love-free, carefree pagans of
Mimosa Hill Plantation, and then it is such trouble
as jealousy. <i>Candy</i> won a ten thousand dollar prize.
<i>Don’t You Weep, Don’t You Moan</i> (1935) did not
win a literary prize, but it did win for its author,
Richard Coleman, the distinction (bandied about by
so many publishers) of being one who in a single book
presented “the true Southern Negro.” Needless to
say Coleman approves the old dogmas such as “A
nigger ... like de cotton fiel’ bettuh den any othuh
place in de worl’ ...” and omits from his novel of
exotic primitives any mention of insult and injustice.</p>

<p><i>Florida.</i> Unlike Mrs. Alexander and Coleman,
Zora Neale Hurston has no need to rely upon either
DuBose Heyward or Julia Peterkin. Her short
stories “Drenched With Light,” “Spunk” and “The
Gilded Six Bits” showed a command of folklore and
idiom excelled by no earlier Negro novelist. <i>Jonah’s
Gourd Vine</i> (1934) recounts the rise of handsome,
stalwart John Buddy from plowboy to moderator of
the Baptists of Florida. But his flair for preaching and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
praying is exceeded by his weakness for women; even
when he is married to the devoted Lucy who is “pretty
as a speckled pup,” he still cannot hold his straying
feet. His fall is as abrupt as his rise. Loosely constructed,
the novel presents authentic scenes of timber
camps, railroad gangs with the “hammer-muscling
men, the liars, fighters, bluffers and lovers,” and the
all-colored towns of Florida. The folk-speech is richly,
almost too consistently, poetic. The characters are less
developed than the setting; and the life they live is self-contained
and untroubled. Nevertheless, <i>Jonah’s
Gourd Vine</i> contains the stuff of life, well observed and
rendered.</p>

<p>A trained anthropologist as well as a native of
Florida, Zora Neale Hurston has made in <i>Mules and
Men</i> (1935) the first substantial collection of folk-tales
by a Negro scholar. Zestful towards her material,
and completely unashamed of it, she ingratiated
herself with the tellers of tall tales in turpentine camps,
or on store porches, and with the preachers of tall
sermons in backwoods churches. Whether of the folk
hero John, or of Brer Dog, Brer Snail, and Brer
Gator, or of more contemporary people and activity,
Miss Hurston’s “big old lies” are a delight to read.
Miss Hurston writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Negro, in spite of his open-faced laughter, his seeming
acquiescence, is particularly evasive. You see we are a polite
people and do not say to our questioner: ‘Get out of here!’ We
smile and tell him or her something that satisfies the white person,
because, caring so little about us, he doesn’t know what he is
missing.... ‘He can read my writing but he sho’ can’t read my
mind.’</p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, <i>Mules and Men</i> does not uncover so
much that white collectors have been unable to get.
The tales ring genuine, but there seem to be omissions.
The picture is too pastoral, with only a bit of
grumbling about hard work, or a few slave anecdotes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
that turn the tables on old marster. The bitterness that
E. C. L. Adams recorded in <i>Nigger to Nigger</i> is not
to be found in <i>Mules and Men</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Hurston’s second novel, <i>Their Eyes Were
Watching God</i> (1937) is informed and sympathetic.
After unfortunate marriages—the first husband, a
grubbing farmer, looked like “some old skull-head in
de graveyard,” and the second was intent only upon
being the “big voice” in Eatonville—Janie Sparks is
whirled into an idyllic marriage with high-spirited Tea
Cake. There are good sketches of the all-colored town
where comic-serious debates and tall tales are told on
the mayor’s store porch. But the love story and the
poetic folk-speech are the chief interests. The people,
“ugly from ignorance and broken from being poor,”
who swarm upon the “muck” for short-time jobs, do
not get much attention. Life in the all-colored town
is fairly easy, with enough money and work to go
around. Here and there social protest is evident: in
the aftermath of the hurricane the conscripted grave-diggers
are ordered to make sure of the race of the
victims, since the whites are to get pine coffins, and the
Negroes, quick lime.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They’s mighty particular how dese dead folks goes tuh judgment.
Look lak they think God don’t know nothin’ ’bout de Jim
Crow law.</p>
</div>

<p>The pine barrens and the swamps of Florida are
the setting of Edwin Granberry’s <i>Strangers and Lovers</i>
(1928) in which the mutual hostility of the Negroes
and “crackers,” the brutality and the violence are
skillfully detailed. In Theodore Pratt’s <i>Big Blow</i>
(1936) a poor white girl who lives by herself in the
waste-land is protected by Clay, a giant Negro. When
a “cracker” forces his attention upon her, Clay saves
the girl, apologetically but firmly. The “cracker” is
astounded that Clay has “put hand to a white man.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Clay is strung up by a mob, and it is only by the greatest
luck that he is saved.</p>

<p><i>Georgia.</i> In <i>Glory</i> (1932), Nan Bagby Stephens,
dealing with Negro life in a small southern Georgia
town, is as intimate as Julia Peterkin with Negro
speech and folkways. But her people, not the unmoral
pagans of Blue Brook plantation, are earnest, self-reliant
workers, in whose lives the church plays a very
important part. The new minister, though not an
Elmer Gantry, brings grief to the community by seducing
Leah, one of the finest girls of his congregation.
Roseanne, her sister, in a melodramatic scene confronts
him with news of the girl’s death, and revenge
is swift. Although the seduction scenes are unconvincing,
the setting and characters are well drawn.
Roseanne, shrewd about human nature until hypnotized
by the preacher, is like Heyward’s Mamba and
Hughes’ Aunt Hager, laboring and sacrificing so that
the young will have a chance. Other characters are
interesting: the railroad men, the charcoal peddler, the
hair-dresser who says, “I puts ’em in and I takes ’em
out,” meaning that she marcels on one side of the railroad
tracks and straightens hair on the other. And
the Ladies Aid Society, pathetically caring for their
little church and worshipful of the preacher, is much
more representative of Negro religion than the usual
scenes of revival frenzy.</p>

<p><i>Death Is A Little Man</i> (1936) by Minnie Hite
Moody likewise deals with a hard-working, sacrificial
heroine of strict morality who, living in the Atlanta
Bottoms, has more than her share of trials and tribulations.
The overfrequent violence becomes melodramatic,
much that affects the life of the Bottoms is
left out, and Fate is blamed too often. But the insight
into character, the true local color and the skillful
prose, entirely in the cadence and idiom of southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Negro speech, bear witness to an informed and sympathetic
observer.</p>

<p><i>The Black Belt.</i> <i>Earth Born</i> by Howard Snyder
(1929) records the superstitions, songs, dances and
church services of tenant farmers in the cotton belt.
Parson Robinson, the Negro plantation owner, the
wanton Malindy, her lover Big Jim Mississippi, and
the violence and loose love making of an isolated community,
are in the tradition of Julia Peterkin. So is
<i>Ollie Miss</i> (1935) by George Wylie Henderson, the
first Negro novelist to deal with sharecroppers. But
the heroine, whether working her crop like a man, or
restlessly hankering after the old days with her lover,
or planning a farm for herself and her child, is well
drawn, and the novel is a work of faithful realism.</p>

<p>Reuben Davis’ <i>Butcher Bird</i> (1936), another story
of Negro sharecroppers, likewise centers attention
upon a woman, “a butcher bird ... one of these here
womens that gobbles up all the mens she can, then
sticks the rest of them around on thorn trees and barb
wire till she gets hongry again.” This wanton brings
trouble to the hard-working hero until his quiet
dependability makes a new woman of her and she
sacrifices her life for his. Written out of considerable
knowledge of folk-life, <i>Butcher Bird</i> excels local color
like <i>Earth Born</i> by its sympathetic characterization.</p>

<p>George Lee’s <i>River George</i> (1936) is less concerned
with free love affairs that end in violence, and
more with the troubles of sharecropping life disclosed
by recent studies. In the first part, as good a picture of
sharecropping as any Negro author has achieved,
George is a good worker, but since he is educated,
knows when he is cheated, and teaches organization,
he is a “bad Negro.” He becomes worse when the
Negro paramour of a white man falls in love with
him. Forced to run away to Memphis after shooting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the white man, he becomes the legendary man of the
river, told of in the author’s earlier <i>Beale Street</i>.
Unreasonably, he returns to his native section and is
lynched upon arrival. The second part of the book
contains too much, but the first is truthful and therefore
bitter. Its grimness stands in no need of the final
less credible lynching.</p>

<p><i>The Delta.</i> Evans Wall writes in <i>The No-Nation
Girl</i> (1929) of Précieuse, the daughter of a white
swamp-dweller and a Negro woman. It is the conventional
story of the mulatto, who “had no right to
be born,” falling in love with a white “outsider” and
when abandoned, drowning herself in Suicide Basin,
convenient for “no-nation girls.” The primitive
goings-on are often halted for dogmas about the
mulatto. Whenever she is decent, it is because of the
inheritance from her father, who was a degraded
outcast. But in moments of passion, her mother’s
inheritance rules:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The girl’s half-heritage of savagery rose in a flood that washed
away all trace of her father’s people except the supersensitiveness
imparted by her taut nerves. She must dance or scream to relieve
the rising torrent of response to the wild, monotonous rhythm.</p>
</div>

<p>In <i>Love Fetish</i> (1933) Wall deals with a “no-nation
boy” in similar fashion.</p>

<p><i>Gulf Stream</i> (1930) by Marie Stanley has more
sympathy for the Creole heroine, but drives home the
same thesis—that you “can’t hide from God and
Affaca.” Adele, with “cream-ivory, magnolia petal
skin” is easily seduced by a white man to whose home
she delivers laundry. When her child is born, she
refuses to look at it, fearing it will be black. Years
later when she discovers that her daughter is milky-white,
she becomes a devoted mother. The daughter,
broadened by education, becomes engaged to a dark
Negro. Adele cannot endure this, and walks into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
bay to commit suicide, but love for her daughter makes
her renounce the usual gesture of the tragic octoroon.
Mille Fleurs Island, below Mobile, the home of
mulatto Creoles of wealth and culture, is new to fiction,
as is Adele’s final tirade against the father of her
child. But there is also much of the usual trite generalizing
about the tragedy of mixed blood.</p>

<p><i>Louisiana.</i> Barry Benefield’s <i>Short Turns</i> (1926)
includes two stories of Negro life. In “Ole Mistis”
Old Jeff, one of the many “slaves of legal documents
and ruthless legal machinery,” loses his crops and
farm, and would have lost his horse, “Ole Mistis,” but
for a landlord’s last-minute kindheartedness. “Sugar
Pie” tells of the terror in a northern Louisiana town
when Negroes are burned out, tarred and feathered,
and hanged upon telegraph poles. Sugar Pie leaves
the hate-ridden town, carrying the corpse of her nearly
white baby. <i>Green Margins</i> by E. P. O’Donnell
(1936) is a poetic book of the life in the delta below
New Orleans, the melting pot of Slavonian, Filipino,
French, Italian, Cajan and Negro fishermen, trappers
and smugglers. Outstanding among the strange characters
are the mulatto girl, Unga January, and Bonus,
a mad Negro murderer. O’Donnell’s short stories
about Negro life such as “Jesus Knew” are informed,
bitter realism.</p>

<p>Elma Godchaux’ <i>Stubborn Roots</i> (1936) has a
weird Negro character in Zero, who, although he
insists upon wearing woman’s clothing, is the dynamic
foreman on a sugar cane plantation. The respect and
liking between Zero and the planter is persuasively
conveyed. Other Negroes are convincingly shown at
their work of planting and grinding cane and repairing
the Mississippi levees. The same fidelity is in
Miss Godchaux’ “The Horn That Called Bambine”
and “Chains,” which contain sympathetic characterizations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
of Negro life along the river, with recognition
of the brutality.</p>

<p>Lyle Saxon has brought to his novel <i>Children of
Strangers</i> (1937) the skill and authority of his studies
of New Orleans. Contrary to the usual procedure,
the Negroes are treated with seriousness, and the
patronizing whites who see Negroes “as the happiest
people in the world” are ridiculed. Famie, the beautiful
descendant of the free mulattoes who once,
cultured and wealthy, owned vast plantations on Cane
River, is the tragic heroine. After a traditional love
affair with a white outlaw, Famie devotes herself to
her child. Poverty-stricken, she sells some of the
ancient heirlooms, then she becomes a servant for
whites. These are violations of the caste-tabus,
whereas having a child by a white man was not. When,
in her loneliness, she turns to black people, and finally
accepts the attention of Henry Tyler, she cuts the last
family tie. <i>Children of Strangers</i> reveals a little
known locale and people, the last of a</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>delicate race of Latins which had lived too near the sun.... The
very old were curiously erect, their shoulders back, their chins up.
They were sad, but they had dignity.... The boys and girls
were handsome, their skins cream-colored or light tan....</p>
</div>

<p>Almost as interesting as Famie is Henry Tyler, a
“shut mouth nigger—studying to himself all the time,
wanting to learn to read letters.” The only socially
conscious character in the book says to Henry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has always been like this in the South ... white men leaning
on black men ... from the beginning. We made slaves of
you.... You made us rich.... In rising, we pushed you further
away from us.... Black men began to think, to move about, to
go away.... That is why I couldn’t get you out of my mind as
I watched you sweating in the field working for something that
can never be yours because I have taken it from you.</p>
</div>

<p>Short story writers have industriously added to this
new regionalism, in such numbers that even mention
of their names is impracticable. Wilbur Daniel Steele,
however, should be mentioned for his grasp of folklore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and types apparent in such stories as “Sooth”
and “Conjure.” Other stories of distinction are
James Boyd’s “Bloodhound,” Vernon Sherwin’s
“Nigger-Lover,” from the many good stories of Negro
life published in <i>Story Magazine</i>, and Louis Paul’s
“No More Trouble For Jedwick.” The liberal and
radical magazines are publishing informed and sincere
fiction of Negro life. <i>The Crisis</i> and <i>Opportunity</i>,
Negro magazines, have published many good interpretations
“from the inside.” Skill and penetration
mark such stories as “Symphonesque” by Arthur Huff
Fauset, “The Flyer” by Cecil Blue, “Swamp Moccasin”
and “Fog” by John F. Matheus, and the work of
Henry Jones.</p>

<p>An admittedly inadequate word might be included
here on children’s books. In a long line from <i>Little
Black Sambo</i> to the newest <i>Ezekiel</i> by Elvira Garner
(1937) Negro children have generally been written
of in the same terms as their mothers and fathers, as
quaint, living jokes, designed to make white children
laugh. Against this tradition of comic condescension,
Eva Knox Evans, in <i>Araminta</i> (1935) and <i>Jerome
Anthony</i> (1936), has written with sincere and informed
sympathy. The same qualities are in the
children’s stories of Arna Bontemps, one of the most
versatile Negro authors, who collaborated with Langston
Hughes on <i>Popo and Fifina</i> (1933) a story of
Haitian children, and has written <i>You Can’t Pet A
Possum</i> (1936) and <i>Sad Faced Boy</i> (1937).</p>

<p class="c">NEW ROADS</p>


<p><i>The Pattern of Violence.</i> Although we have seen
that such authors as Wood, Heyward, Adams and
Frank revealed southern injustice to the Negro, it
has remained for a later group of writers to register
the fullest social protest. They know the land of the
jasmines and myrtles; but they know a great deal
more about it than those gentle symbols. Aware that
one southern tradition—that of violence—is as long-standing
as any, they have added darker color to
the picture of the regionalists and folk-lorists, who
often in their search for the peculiar and amusing,
overlooked harsh and socially significant facts. They
record what, according to the formula of taboos and
restrictions, should be unmentioned. In spite of the
chorus of comfortable and ostrich-like people who
insist that in their state “the problem has been solved,”
they reveal a widespread pattern of violence.</p>

<p><i>Sweet Man</i> (1930) by Gilmore Millen tells of John
Henry, the son of a white plantation agent who could
not let Negro women alone. John Henry launches
out as a “sweet man,” attractive to women, on the
plantations and in Memphis, and finally becomes the
paramour of a wealthy white woman in California.
When, unbalanced by jealousy, she tries to frame him
for rape, he kills her, then himself. The early chapters
give a good, naturalistic picture of plantation life;
the last chapters, even though sensational, are convincing.</p>

<p><i>Amber Satyr</i> by Roy Flannagan (1932) is similar
in some respects. Luther, strong and handsome, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Negro-Indian stock, has caution enough to resist the
open advances of the love-sick farm wife for whom
he works. But through her brazenness, the affair is
discovered, and Luther is killed by her two brothers-in-law.
The newspaper report is the usual one:
Luther was killed by an unknown mob. In ironic contrast,
one of Luther’s murderers is the father of a
child by Luther’s daughter, and at the time of the
tragedy a special session of the Virginia legislature
is considering the “racial-integrity” bill. <i>Amber Satyr</i>
is shot through with sardonic humor, but its chief
impact is tragic.</p>

<p>Less spectacular, Welbourn Kelley’s <i>Inchin’ Along</i>
(1932) deals with Dink Britt, whose enterprise and
endurance make him a dangerous example to the croppers,
white and black, who must be kept brow-beaten
and shiftless. A marked man, he narrowly escapes
being lynched. <i>Inchin’ Along</i> has some traditional
and silly comments about racial characteristics, but the
sympathy for the plugging hero and the picture of
the hard lot of the tenant farmer, show Kelly to be
clear-eyed and courageous.</p>

<p>Robert Rylee is well informed about life in delta
Mississippi, and deeply concerned with its injustice.
In <i>Deep Dark River</i> (1935) Mose Southwick, a share-cropper,
protests against his wife’s carryings-on with
the plantation manager. In self defense Mose kills a
bad Negro, hired to kill him. When Mose is captured
and framed, a liberal white woman lawyer takes his
case, but cannot defeat the concerted line-up. Mose is
dependable, sober, self-contained, with grim, double-edged
humor, and burdened by the miseries of his
people even more than by his own. So Mose must be
put out of the way. <i>Deep Dark River</i> is unconvincing
where Rylee makes his hero a symbol of Christian
resignation and attachment to the soil, and is conventional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
in such statements as “Mose had the mystic
singing and intuitiveness of the black race and the
intelligence of the white race.” The white characters
here are less intelligent than stupid and vicious. Although
humane, Rylee does not idealize the Negro; he
includes sketches of Negro highjackers, bootleggers,
easy women, and toadies for white folks. His second
novel <i>St. George of Weldon</i> (1937) is a character
study of a sensitive southern youth, and the harsh
treatment of the Negro is an important element in his
education.</p>

<p>In <i>Death in The Deep South</i> (1936) by Ward
Greene, a novel of southern injustice, the use of the
third degree to exact confessions from Negroes is
powerfully depicted. Theodore Strauss’ <i>Night At
Hogwallow</i> (1937) is a hair-raising narrative. A
Negro laborer is falsely accused of rape. This results
in a battle between a northern road crew and the
aroused southern townsmen, a beating by the Klan,
the burning of the Negro section, and a gruesome
lynching. It is a dark melodrama, as life in towns
like Hogwallow too often is.</p>

<p>Jim Tully’s <i>Circus Parade</i> (1927) tells the story of
“Whiteface,” a Negro who rose from stake-driver to
clown, and who was burned at the stake by a mob on
the rampage because a Negro had stepped in front of
a white woman in the ticket line. “A Negro Girl” is
likewise grim naturalism; the girl, caught sneaking
into the circus, is assaulted by the circus roughnecks.
In <i>Violence, A Story of Today’s South</i> by Marcet and
Emanuel Haldeman-Julius (1928) a Negro boy, in
terror of exposure after a love affair, kills a white
girl. He is saved from a lynching mob, but is electrocuted.
In contrast, a philandering white minister who
commits murder is freed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p><i>Exceptional Negroes.</i> Sinclair Lewis was one of
the first to break with the preconceptions of the Negro
held by Main Street. In <i>Arrowsmith</i> (1925) he includes
a capable Negro scientist who, though a minor
character, stands out from the ruck of the petty, grasping
victims of Lewis’ satire. In <i>Work of Art</i> (1934)
the attractive, intelligent and bookish Tansy Quill
illustrates the “common tragedy of the superior Negro
... laden with all the complexities of twentieth century
America heaped upon the dark burden lugged up from
old Africa’s abyss.” Her suicide is conventional, but
it gives Lewis a chance to satirize authors who, from
a casual acquaintance with a hotel maid, build up
masterpieces about Negro psychology and the voodoo
of the swamps.</p>

<p><i>Come In At The Door</i> (1934) by William March
is merciless in its exposure of certain elements of
southern life, and original in its treatment of Negro
characters. A Negro woman, Mitty, bears six children
to the “aristocrat” Robert Hurry, who, gone to
seed, is now going with the wind in the waste land of
the delta country. Mitty is wily but superstitious,
loyal but self-centered, kindhearted but capable of
fierce hate. The traditional Aunt Hatty and Jim are
well observed. Most striking of the Negro characters
is Baptiste, an educated Creole, a vagabond
philosopher, whose tragedy is to haunt forever the
southern boy whom he tutored.</p>

<p>The portrait of Baptiste indicates that as southern
realists look more closely at life, they too become
aware of exceptional Negroes. T. S. Stribling has
complained that “White educated Southerners are
completely cut off from black educated Southerners by
the inherited attitudes of master and slave, and the
one really does not know the other exists.” Lack of
contact and ignorance still handicap honest realists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
but their attempt at a complete cast of characters is
noteworthy.</p>

<p>To James Saxon Childers, “White men and black
men have long ago walked out of their color and are
only men.” <i>A Novel About A White Man and A
Black Man In The Deep South</i> (1936) deals with
Gordon Nicholson, a white man, and Dave Parker, a
Negro, educated at the same northern school. When
Dave, a talented musician, visits his friend, the southern
town is alarmed, since Gordon has a sister Anne.
Dave is accused of a crime for which there is not a
shred of evidence. He is acquitted, but Anne’s end is
tragic, merely because Dave visits her brother. Irritated
by northern interference as much as by southern
injustice, Childers believes that the “problem” will
gradually be solved by men of good will. His Negro
characters, like most of the educated Negroes in
propaganda novels, are nearly faultless. The novel
is unusual in its sympathy, but it is jumbled, coincidental
and not always plausible.</p>

<p>One of the South’s most promising novelists, Hamilton
Basso included recognizable Negro characters in
<i>Relics and Angels</i> (1929). <i>Cinnamon Seed</i> (1934)
shows deeper understanding of Negroes, both in
slavery and in the present; Horace, the old family
servant; Sam, ambitious, resentful and therefore
doomed, and Lance who rises to be a world famous
“trombone player in a band” are especially well done.
In <i>Courthouse Square</i> (1936) which deals mainly with
the plight of a justice-loving liberal in a southern
town, Basso’s pictures of Negro life are even more
authentic and sympathetic. Of Niggertown, which the
Negroes called High Rent, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Poverty ran through the section like a plague, hunger was a
frequent visitor or permanent boarder in almost every house, but
the inhabitants of High Rent, merging a simple philosophy with
the terrible patience of the poor, complained but little and trusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
in the humanity of a singularly inhumane and white-faced God
for eventual succor and release.</p>
</div>

<p>An unusual character is Alcide Fauget, who is “like
the reverend and respected head of a tribe: banker,
counsellor, physician, friend.” So fair that he had
attended a white southern medical school, he serves
the darker half of his people. Neither obsequious nor
arrogant, he goes his own way. But when he wishes
to buy an old house, falling to rack and ruin, for a
much-needed Negro hospital, he has stepped over his
bounds, and is driven away by a mob of his inferiors.
An intelligent, humane realist, Basso has unobtrusively
but memorably conveyed the tragedy of Negro life
in the South.</p>

<p><i>The “Multiple” Novel</i>: Many writers have
attempted to give cross-sections of the life of southern
towns by using many characters on all levels. Margaret
Sperry’s <i>Portrait of Eden</i> (1934) shows a
Florida town which, after the boom, sinks back into
lethargy and intolerance. The Negroes are generally
shown as exotic primitives, especially at their shouting
services in “The Church of Jesus Colored.” But the
picture has social understanding as well:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aunt Melissie danced, tangling her feet in a bitter tune against
all the days she’d spent serving white folks, walking their ways,
and all her children born to do bidding to white men. She danced
and fell reeling at last, her shoes flung to the darkness....</p>
</div>

<p>Outstanding is the educated Negro, John Marquis, a
native of the section, who, hated by whites and double-crossed
by Negroes, wants to start a school for Negro
children. He is lynched, and a white liberal, his best
friend, is murdered. <i>Portrait of Eden</i> has some exaggeration,
but what it records is not too spectacular
in a state where the Klan still rides.</p>

<p>Less directly intent upon revealing intolerance and
injustice than Basso and Miss Sperry, other novelists
still include these since they wish truthful pictures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
<i>Siesta</i>, by Berry Fleming (1935), is one of the finest
examples. Cotton brokers, cotton farmers, plaintively
wasting “aristocrats,” society folk and crackers,
in “Georgetown,” Alabama, in the long drought of
summer, are unforgettably set before us. Negro
characters, an important part of the town’s life, are
as authentically handled. Laney Shields, ambitious
and decent, is trapped in a sordid love affair with the
young white doctor for whom she is office girl. A little
boy’s going after the laundry becomes a dangerous
odyssey in the bullying town. Mattie Small, the
“obsteprician”; a famed faith-healing Bishop and his
blind stooge, are similarly well drawn. In <i>Siesta</i> the
best talkers refer to the Negro’s tragic mask, and say
that southern whites can know of the Negro only what
he wants them to know. This is wise: Fleming’s
recognition of the tragic mask helps him to get
beneath it.</p>

<p><i>South</i>, by Frederick Wight (1935) attempts a panoramic
view of a South Carolina city. Negro characters
are only slightly sketched domestics or levee
workers. Mob terror threatens the Negro section
at one point, but is averted when the victim is discovered
to be a light-colored Negro woman. The
manufacturing town of “Tuttle,” North Carolina,
comes to life in <i>Where the Weak Grow Strong</i> by
Eugene Armfield (1936). Negro characters are
drawn with attention to truth more than to tradition.
A servant asking for her six weeks back pay of twelve
dollars, is called an “ungrateful nigger” and is ordered
from the house.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss Evelyn, you ain’t got no call to talk to me like that. I
only ast you for what I worked for. I may be a nigger like you
says. The Lord made me the color I is. But I ain’t never done
nobody out of the money that’s coming to them.</p>
</div>

<p>A white mother resents the reserving of the carnival
merry-go-round for Negroes, during the supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
hour for the whites: “They ought not let them do it.”
A love affair between a Negro man and a white
woman is told with quiet, tragic realism.</p>

<p><i>Incidental Characters, But Real.</i> In George Milburn’s
sharply observed <i>Oklahoma Town</i> (1930),
“The Nigger-Lover” tells of a lawyer who earned
his nickname by urging Negroes to vote, who violated
taboos such as handing a Negro boy a glass of water
from a soda fountain, and who is among the first
victims in a race riot. In “The Nigger Doctor” the
educated physician makes the town uneasy by his
quietly defiant manner and his scientific skill. <i>No
More Trumpets</i> (1933) contains a story “white
Meat” in which a boarding house keeper gets her
greatest delight in baiting Negroes and describing a
lynching she saw as a girl. Deserted by her resentful
daughters, she reveals that their father had Negro
blood. In Milburn’s novel <i>Catalogue</i>, the lynching
of a Negro is shown to be one of the holiday excitements
for Oklahoma yokels.</p>

<p>James T. Farrell, in his trilogy <i>Studs Lonigan</i>
(1935), has old man Lonigan commenting on Amos
and Andy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You would have laughed yourself sick at them. They’re so
much like darkies. Not the fresh northern niggers, but the genuine
real southern darkies, the good niggers ... with long
names and honors, just like in real life.... Golly, Bill, they sure
are a card.</p>
</div>

<p>In bitter contrast, however, Farrell shows the anger
of the Chicago Irish to the encroaching black belt.
Studs Lonigan believes that “they ought to hang every
nigger in the city to telephone poles.” Fellow victims
of poverty, the Negroes and Irish have fierce street
fights of which the riot of 1919 was a natural climax,
although Farrell describes the present as similarly
explosive. Except in a few stories, Farrell does not
present individual Negroes, but he has given powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
and grimly true pictures of northern prejudice, which
seems to be little different from the lynch-spirit of the
South.</p>

<p>William Faulkner’s <i>Sartoris</i> (1929) has many
minor but ably individualized Negro characters.
Uncle Simon’s dismaying first automobile ride, and his
difficulties as treasurer of the church board—“he jes
put de money out, sort of,”—are well described.
Simon rebukes his son Caspy, who, home from the
World War is bragging too much: “What us niggers
want ter be free fer, anyhow. Ain’t we got ez many
white folks now ez we kin suppo’t?” The servants
of the tragic family in Faulkner’s <i>The Sound and The
Fury</i> (1920)—Aunt Dilsey, hobbling about her
kitchen, impudent and bullying, with her temper worn
short by the bickering and turmoil, Uncle Job, and
Luster, who is guardian to Benjy, the idiot of the
family—are likewise convincing. The Negroes are
generally described from the point of view of their
harassed white folks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like I say the only place for them is in the field, where they’d
have to work from sunup to sundown.... They got so they
can outguess you about work before your very eyes.... Shirking
and giving you a little more lip and a little more lip until some
day you have to lay them out with a scantling or something....</p>
</div>

<p>The Negroes themselves are an unflattering chorus
in this drama of the fall of a family. One of them
expresses their surliness: “I works to suit de man
whut pays me Sat’day night. When I does dat, it
don’t leave me a whole lot of time to please other
folks.” Insolent just up to the breaking point, contradicting
their white-folks without apologies, these
servants are miles away from the plantation tradition
menials. If familiarity has not bred contempt, it has
at least bred rough irony in place of worship.</p>

<p><i>These Thirteen</i> (1931) contains “That Evening
Sun,” one of the best of Negro stories. A Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
woman is shown waiting in dread suspense, certain that
her husband is going to kill her. Nancy is truculent
and cynical about humanity whether white or black.
Her husband is likewise desperate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I can’t hang around white man’s kitchen. But white man can
hang around mine. White man can come in my house, but I can’t
stop him. When white man wants to come in my house, I ain’t
got no house. I can’t stop him, but he can’t kick me outen it. He
can’t do that.</p>
</div>

<p>“Dry September” is a powerful lynching story, but
the stress is less upon the victim than upon the psychology
of the mob, especially of the leader. No one
knows whether the assault happened or was imagined,
but the mob gets its man.</p>

<p>In <i>Sanctuary</i> (1929) the incidental picture of a
jailed Negro murderer is striking:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He would lean in the window in the evening and sing. After
supper a few Negroes gathered along the fence below—natty,
shoddy suits and sweat-stained overalls shoulder to shoulder—and
in chorus with the murderer, they sang ... “Fo days mo!
Den dey ghy ’stroy de bes’ ba’ytone singer in Nawth Mississippi!”</p>
</div>

<p><i>Light in August</i> (1932) has as its most interesting
character Joe Christmas. A foundling, the son of a
white mother and a Negro father, he is raised by his
fanatical grandfather. Taken for white until the
mystery of his birth is cleared up, he is silent, friendless
and proud. After he murders a sex-obsessed Yankee
woman, a relic of Reconstruction, he is pursued
and killed. Although one character imputes his
tragedy to the warfare in him of white and black,
there is sufficient reason to see him as a victim of a
hostile environment. He is more complex than Faulkner’s
other Negroes, fully characterized, and one of
Faulkner’s most memorable creations.</p>

<p>Faulkner is a naturalist, and sees humanity in a
harsh light. Like the weak, mean, and degenerate
white characters whom he has set before us, his Negro
characters are shown unflatteringly. House-servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and farmers, loose women and murderers; whether in
rocking ecstasy in church, or getting the third degree
from a sheriff, or fearing to help out in an accident—“White
folks be sayin’ we done it”—they are all
equally convincing. Faulkner records Negro speech
with complete accuracy, but more important, he gets
into character with the uncanny penetration that
makes him one of the most significant of the new novelists.
His Negroes are a long way from happy-go-lucky
comics. If they agree in anything, it is in their
surly understanding of the bitter life that they are
doomed to live in a backward, hate-ridden South.
He does not write social protest, but he is fiercely
intent upon the truth, and the truth that he sees is
tragic.</p>

<p>In <i>Tobacco Road</i>, after a Negro has been run down
by the crazy-driving of a poor-white, Jeeter philosophizes:
“Wal, niggers will get kilt.” The same callousness
is depicted in Caldwell’s first book, <i>American
Earth</i> (1931). “Saturday Afternoon” tells of a mob’s
filling a Negro “so full of lead that his body sagged
from his neck where the trace-chain held him up.”
The Negro was too smart a farmer. “Savannah River
Payday” is even more gruesome. A Negro sawmill
hand, killed in an accident, is being carried to the
town’s undertaker. The drunk “crackers” driving the
car hammer out his gold teeth and fight over them.
Arriving in town, they go into a pool room and forget
all about the corpse. <i>We Are The Living</i> (1933)
contains Negro cotton-pickers, and servants whose
attractiveness is a household problem. The stories are
frequently humorous but the laughter of the Negroes
is ironic at perplexed and inept “superiors.”</p>

<p>“Candy Man Beechum” in <i>Kneel To The Rising Sun</i>
(1935) is about a travelling boy with flapping feet,
who, on his way to see his gal, is shot down for nothing
by a white policeman. “Blue Boy” is the ugly anecdote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of a Negro idiot whose grotesque tricks entertain
a group of satiated “high class ladies and gentlemen.”
“Kneel To The Rising Sun”, probably Caldwell’s
greatest short story, portrays the misery of short-rationed
sharecroppers, the sadism of ignorant, bored
landlords, the crushing force of an unjust system.
Lonnie, a white man, made a whining coward by years
of share-cropping slavery, betrays Clem, who has
befriended him, to their mutual enemy the landlord,
and his mob of lynchers. Clem is a doggedly courageous
Negro, willing to take only so much before
rebelling.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All Arch asked ... was for Clem Henry to overstep his place
just one little half inch, or to talk back to him with just one little
short word, and he would do the rest. Everybody knew what
Arch meant by that, especially if Clem did not turn and run.
And Clem had not been known to run from anybody, after fifteen
years in the country.</p>
</div>

<p>Caldwell is convinced that “much of the matter about
the southern Negro and the southern white man has
been a garbled mixture of romance and mis-statement,”
and the authoritative fiction he writes about his native
sharecropping country bears this out.</p>

<p><i>Proletarian Realism.</i> Caldwell’s “Kneel To The
Rising Sun” represents one of the most important
trends in contemporary fiction. The Negro is at last
being discovered as part of the working class. Radical
novelists now stress the exploitation of the Negro
masses, and urge that it is only by the solidarity of
all workers that a new social order can be achieved.
In spite of the overstress of propaganda, these writers
contribute a great deal to realism. Seeing many of
the so-called Negro characteristics as class disabilities,
aware of much that is common in the lives of the
poor, they have been able to get close to their characters,
without condescension and without idealizing.
They start from the basic beliefs that the Negro has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
been a great factor in building up America, that he
has been miserably underpaid, that he is growing
steadily more conscious of, and restive under exploitation,
and that he can get nowhere without the white
worker, nor the white worker without him. These
are all truths that have long needed to be told. By
themselves, they do not guarantee good fiction, but
they cannot be neglected without falsity to Negro experience,
and the contemporary American scene.</p>

<p>Scott Nearing’s <i>Free-Born</i> (1932), “unpublishable
by any commercial concern,” is as well documented as
his <i>Black America</i>, a sociological exposé of exploitation
and persecution. The title is ironic: the “freeborn”
Negroes are landless sharecroppers, kept from “jumping
contracts” by a patrol system. One southern judge
threatens to adjourn court and “attend to the matter
himself” if there are not enough “he-Americans” to
do a job of lynching. Jim, the hero, sees the burning
of the Rosenwald school and the lynching of his
mother and father (one of the most gruesome ever
recorded in fiction and taken from actuality). His
sweetheart is raped and murdered. In Chicago he is
caught up in the race-riot. Embittered and desperate,
he is taught by a communist that “t’aint cause you’se
black that you’se exploited,” and that only by fighting
shoulder to shoulder with white workers will there
ever be a “free world under working class control.”
Rebuffed by labor leaders, Jim nevertheless sticks to his
new-found cause. Jailed for leading a strike, he dedicates
himself to black and white slaves “who never
were freed ... who keep your high and mighty world
a-goin’.” <i>Free-Born</i> crowds too much upon the shoulders
of its young hero, and is unconvincing in such
details as Jim’s continued dialect after he has read
Upton Sinclair, Marx and Lenin. But it is significant
as the first revolutionary novel of Negro life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p><i>Georgia Nigger</i> (1932) is another exposure, attacking
the convict-lease system and the chain-gang, with
thorough documentation based upon visits, prison
records and photographs. Spivak describes such
devices of punishment as the iron collar, spikes, double-shackles,
the stocks, the whipping post, the Georgia
rack, where convicts are tortured by stretching, and
the “sweat-box, a coffin of thick wood standing upright.”
The convicts who rot their lives away in the
filthy cages may be robbers and killers, or they may
just as often be like David, a mere lad, picked up on
petty charges to do the county’s hard work. Arrested
in a round-up because Mr. Deering, in cahoots with the
sheriff, has a lot of cotton to be picked, David is
“redeemed” by the planter. Escaping from Deering’s
armed camp, where Negroes who die from overwork
are weighted and buried in the swamp, David is rearrested
as a vagrant, and this time chooses the chain
gang in preference to peonage, exchanging hell for hell.
Throughout <i>Georgia Nigger</i> the Negro is shown to be
a catspaw; vicious and murderous guards, landlords
and sheriffs nullify the half-hearted interference of the
better-disposed whites. But it contains more than the
shocking; the heartbreaking struggle of David’s family
against poverty is conveyed with deep feeling.</p>

<p>In Myra Page’s <i>Gathering Storm</i> (1932) the hill-people
who have become underpaid, hungry “lint-heads,”
doomed to shameful living, and the Negroes
whose wretchedness is even greater, come together
because of common suffering. Marge, a child of hill-people,
reaches out to Negro workers “across the
miles”, denounces the old way of hatred and bitterness,
and urges the new way of solidarity. She and a Negro
organizer are forerunners of the “gathering storm.”
Like <i>Free-Born</i> in many respects, covering too much
ground, <i>Gathering Storm</i> is even more of a thesis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
novel. But Miss Page’s sympathy with her Negro
characters goes deep.</p>

<p>Dealing with a similar setting, <i>Call Home The
Heart</i> contains but few scenes involving Negroes.
Ishma, a mountain woman, saves a Negro organizer
from a lynch mob but is revolted by close contact with
Negroes: “Mountain people are always white.” A
matured radical, recognizing the strength of her long-bred
prejudice, patiently tries to persuade her that
unless the workers of both races stand together, they
will continue to be clubbed, driven and starved. Miss
Burke’s <i>A Stone Came Rolling</i> (1935) contains more
about the Negro. The “kindliness” of the past is
satirized in an excellent description of a slave-trading.
The present is desperate: a Negro woman says: “I
ain’t had what you could call work in six months—not
a tap at a snake.” An educated Negro, brought in as a
safe speaker at a political rally, waits until white hearers
have left, and then attacks the conservative speechmakers
and urges Negroes to organize. Unemployed
whites and Negroes march together, singing militant
words to hymn tunes. In such a crisis, the city fathers,
churchmen, and sheriff must have a victim. Stomp
Nelson, a tireless, fearless, Negro organizer is selected,
but by a ruse, his white comrades of the Unemployed
Council save him from the mob. Negro characters are
not major actors, but the Negro is shown as an
important participant in the stirring of southern labor.
The use of race prejudice by the overlords to prevent
workers’ solidarity is clearly indicated.</p>

<p>In <i>Now In November</i> (1934) and <i>Winter Orchard</i>
(1935) Josephine Johnson occasionally describes the
harshness of Negro life. Her <i>Jordanstown</i> (1937)
records a fight for better living conditions for the
jobless and the underpaid in a small midwestern town.
Anna Mosely, “a tall, mammoth Negress ... too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
articulate and brooding for her own people, too proud
to be popular with employers ... alien in the bitter
gifts of intelligence and race” is an interesting person,
whether in her married life with Ham, or talking in
meetings, or writing the song for the disinherited, or
leading the march, or lying unconquered in jail, or
inspiring the young white leaders: “Not till we do
something all together ... we won’t change mo’ than
a stitch in the world.”</p>

<p>The bitterness and understanding of Grace Lumpkin’s
“White Man” (1927), the story of a Negro girl
seduced by her employer, reappears with added power
in <i>A Sign For Cain</i> (1935). A small southern community
is well realized: the well meaning but weak
liberals, resenting any interference with their “contented
nigras”; the respectable judge (bought and paid
for); the bootlegging and pandering leader of the
American Legion who is the defender of law and
order; the white men with their Negro women; the
high-school boys ripe for violence; and the sheriff who
keeps the Negroes “scared to raise their voices too
high.” Nevertheless, when Denis, a young organizer
returns home, he finds allies ready to join his struggle
for justice. Denis is slowly but surely bringing about
the union of underpaid white and black workers, when
a few leaflets are lost, and traitors sell him out.
Framed for the murder of a wealthy white woman,
Denis is shot by the real murderer, who fears investigation
by the northern lawyers. Denis is quiet but
strong, humble only before the great work he has set
himself to do; in jail, attacked by the deputies, he cries
out “I’ve got no rights as a citizen. Then I stand on
my rights as a man.” Other Negroes are well done:
Mum Nancy, whose long years of meekness bring a
sorry inheritance; Selah, the bound-out slavey, awaking
to courage and hatred; Brother Shadrack Morton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
whose sermon on submissiveness in lynch-time is
drowned out by groans, and Ficents, easy-going, but
insisting “I got some fight in me yet; if there’s something
to fight for.” Most interesting after Denis is old
Ed Clarke, whose memory of his lynched father is still
burning, a hard worker, unlearned but manly, leaving
one master because he could do with “less kindness
and more cash,” and contemptuous of “white-folks’
niggers.” The old plantation record furnishes ironic
asides: one entry reads, “Sold Negro $1,200. Beautiful
day”; another reads, “Candies for little Negroes
... 25 cents worth.”</p>

<p><i>Negro Novelists On New Roads.</i> Except for a few
cartoons, such as <i>Two Black Crows in the A.E.F.</i>, the
Negro in the World War has been scarcely mentioned.
Victor Daly’s <i>Not Only War</i> (1932) “dedicated to
the army of disillusioned,” attempts to do justice to
the record of Negro troops. There is less about warfare,
however, than about the workings of race prejudice.
A southern white officer, who has carried on a
flirtation with a Negro girl in the states, “breaks” a
Negro non-commissioned officer for visiting a French
girl. In a big drive the white officer is wounded; the
Negro soldier tries to save his life. They are found
the next morning, “face downward, their arms about
each other.” Coincidences are too much relied upon,
and the novel follows the apologist pattern, but the
aim to deal seriously with what has been caricatured
is noteworthy. <i>Greater Need Below</i> (1936) by
O’Wendell Shaw deals with the life of a southern
Negro college, but the characters are too idealized,
and the plot is forced. The subject deserves a better
novel.</p>

<p>Langston Hughes, in <i>The Ways of White Folks</i>
(1934), his first collection of short stories, shows far
superior artistry. All of the stories deal with manifestations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
of white prejudice. Hughes states that by
white folks he really means “some white folks,” but
the stories which turn the tables of caricature and
contempt often seem inclusive. “Slave On the Block”
and “The Blues I’m Playing” satirize the people “who
went in for Negroes—a race that was too charming
and naive and lovely for words.” “A Good Job
Gone” shows the break-up of a wealthy white man
who, fascinated by a golden-brown wanton, is jilted
for a Negro elevator boy. “Rejuvenation Through
Joy” farcically tells of a colony of effete whites who
listen to lectures by a Negro, passing for white, who
preaches the occult value of primitive rhythm. “Cora,”
one of the most successful stories, attacks small town
puritanism. In “Home” a world renowned artist
returns home to be lynched as an “uppity nigger.” In
“Father and Son,” from which the play <i>Mulatto</i> was
taken, the son of Colonel Norwood and his housekeeper,
determined not to be “a white folks’ nigger,”
chokes his father to death after a quarrel and is
lynched. In this not always convincing story, Hughes
looks forward to the time when</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the cotton will blaze and the cabins will burn and the chains will
be broken, and men, all of a sudden, will shake hands, black men
and white men, like steel meeting steel.</p>
</div>

<p>Hughes does not often strike this radical note in <i>The
Ways of White Folks</i>; most of his stories protest jim-crow
insults and injustice. In “Professor,” one of his
latest stories, he attacks the compromising race
“leader.” Hughes’ stories exist largely for the theses,
but they are skillfully done, realistic in detail and
bitingly ironic.</p>

<p>One of the most promising explorations of a new
road is Richard Wright’s “Big Boy Leaves Home,”
which appeared in <i>The New Caravan</i> (1936). The
portrait of the gang of Negro boys in the South is done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
with robust understanding. Swimming in a pool
posted “No Trespassing,” which meant “No dogs
and niggers allowed,” the boys are caught by a white
man. In a fight after one of the boys has been shot,
Big Boy gets possession of the man’s rifle, and when
the white man lunges for it, Big Boy shoots him. His
pal, Bobo, is caught and lynched. The terror of the
community before Big Boy is spirited away is graphically
conveyed. “Big Boy Leaves Home” is well informed
realism, rendered with power and originality.</p>

<p>Without the distinction of Wright’s technique,
Waters Edward Turpin’s <i>These Low Grounds</i> (1937)
is still extremely promising. For the first time a Negro
novelist tells the story of four generations of Negroes.
Thoroughly conversant with the life of the farmers
and crabbers and oyster shuckers of the Eastern Shore,
Turpin has had the courage to handle this life without
idealization, without shame, but with full sympathy.
The story has its bitterness and sharp protest. Poverty
is omnipresent, and oppression. The town of
Shrewsbury is really Salisbury, ill-famed because of a
recent lynching, and Turpin describes this tragedy.
His characters, for all of their illiteracy and squalor,
have dogged courage. Less successful in his hasty
sketches of the life of better off Negroes in the big
cities, Turpin’s novel still belongs with the best novels
by Negro authors.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> If many of the foregoing books have
contained lynchings, this may partly be explained as a
natural reaction to books that have stressed the contented,
comical or quaintly picturesque Negro in a
sunny South which “understands him.” It is important
that American novelists are revealing the tragic
in Negro experience. This has been present from the
earliest, and honest observers know that it has been
met with fortitude and struggle. Some novelists have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
recorded the brutality and shame as part of a tragic
America; others show the Negro resisting heroically;
and still others, hoping for social justice, are urging
solidarity of all of the oppressed. They indicate a
new and momentous trend in modern literature. It is
a trend that makes the way easier for Negro novelists
who, coming of age in technique and understanding,
will find an audience ready for the important stories
that still must be told.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c12">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="c">HISTORICAL FICTION</p>


<p>The present vogue of historical fiction has given
new impetus to the long-standing interest in the Old
South and the Negro. The African slave-trade, the
antebellum and the reconstruction South are popular
hunting grounds. Some novelists continue the plantation
tradition, some, the antislavery tradition, and
many others, in the spirit of regionalism, seek the truth
of their sectional pasts, without apology and without
indictment.</p>

<p><i>The Slave Trade.</i> The ghastly middle passage, the
shackled mobs below the hatches, the lack of water,
the plagues, are background for novels like Mary
Johnston’s <i>The Slave Ship</i> (1924), and George King’s
<i>The Last Slaver</i> (1936). Deeper pity and understanding
inform <i>The Trader’s Wife</i> (1930) by Jean
Kenyon McKenzie. A sheltered Newport girl confronted
by the traffic—“Wretched blacks at sea,
packed in trays like dead fish, stinking like fish, some
of them to die ... and to be cast in the sea”—is
broken in Africa by the misery of the barracoon. As
her last gesture before she dies she sets free a contingent
of slaves.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With the dawn there came a wailing on the river—as the
canoes multiplied at the landing—the high desolate wailing that
is the voice of the sorrows of Africa.... It was the slaves come
down the river into the barracoon.</p>
</div>

<p>Hervey Allen’s <i>Anthony Adverse</i> (1933) describes
the barracoons through which “Africa was poured
into America,” the serpent-like line</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>composed of hundreds of naked, human bodies rubbed slimy for
their approaching sale with palm oil and rancid butter....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Bamboo withes stretched from one tight neck-fork to another....
Hovering about it, and along its flanks were white-robed
Arabs with rhinoceros-hide whips.</p>
</div>

<p>The bartering, with slaves coquettish, or compliant, or
sullen, or tiger-like, the inspections and the packing on
the slave-ships are fully pictured, obviously after a
great deal of research. But it strikes one as historical
pageantry rather than tragedy.</p>

<p>In <i>Babouk</i> (1934), Guy Endore concentrates upon
the shocking features of the slave-trade: the captives
“lying shoulder to shoulder, feet pointing toward the
center, not only chained in pairs, but each pair attached
to a great chain—a gigantic necklace of blacks”; the
separated tribesmen forced to sing and dance—“a
centipede dancing, chains clanking”; opthalmy and
other epidemics ravaging the hold. “Nigger-tasters,”
telling the slaves’ condition by their sweat, and other
connoisseurs of black flesh winnowed out the drugged,
the doctored; only the finest were fit to be slaves. After
horrible life on San Domingo plantations the slaves
revolt. Based upon considerable research, convincing
in its descriptions of the slave-trade, of African tales
and customs, and of West Indian plantations, <i>Babouk</i>
is still more than a historical romance. It is a revolutionary
novel, bitterly opposed to imperialism and the
contemporary slavery of any race.</p>

<p><i>The Plantation Tradition.</i> But Endore is unusual;
Joseph Hergesheimer is much more typical. In <i>Quiet
Cities</i> (1927) he yearns for the return of the past,
based on slavery—for which “I’d be happy to pay—with
everything, everything the wasted present holds.”
In his picture slaves do little other than raise soft
staves of song, or play quoits, or fiddle, or sleep. The
only ugly feature is an ill-smelling slave-den, for which
a transplanted northerner is responsible. Emancipation
was a failure since “a free Negro is more often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
wretched than not.” Reconstruction was ignominious:
Negro legislators dared to utter shouts of laughter,
with “incredible feet elevated on the desks” in southern
state capitols. Mingo Harth, a vicious Negro politician
worthy of Thomas Dixon, is called a “symbol of
Union, a black seal on the fate of South Carolina.”</p>

<p>Most of the historical romances repeat these patterns
with little variation. Dealing with the times of
George Washington, <i>Princess Malah</i> (1933), by a
Negro author, John H. Hill, subscribes in the main to
the plantation tradition of humaneness, mutual affection
and lavishness. Frances Griswold’s <i>The Tides
of Malvern</i> (1930) and Caroline Gordon’s <i>Penhally</i>
(1931) recount the long history of southern families
with Negro characters in the background, where they
stay correctly. A few step out of the picture after
Sherman’s march, but the majority will not be moved.
In Mary Johnston’s <i>Miss Delicia Allen</i> (1933) both
Negro slaves and white owners are conventionally
drawn.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar to Cable’s <i>Madame Delphine</i> is
E. Laroque Tinker’s <i>Toucoutou</i> (1928). After being
married to a white man, Toucoutou is proved in court
to be partly Negro. In bitter envy, Negroes satirize
her in street-songs; whites condemn her because her
marriage means that “a black flood will rush through
the crevasse that will sully white purity and retard our
civilization a thousand years.” The picture of New
Orleans is not idyllic; the yellow fever epidemic, the
exotic <i>bamboula</i>, <i>calinda</i> and <i>counjaille</i> danced in the
<i>Place Congo</i>, and other customs of New Orleans are
vividly described. With some sympathy for his
heroine, Tinker yields at times to the doubtful traditions
about the mulatto. <i>Old New Orleans</i> (1931)
by E. Laroque Tinker and Frances Tinker presents
minor and familiar Negro characters. Life on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
lower Mississippi, in a later period is in Edna Ferber’s
<i>Show-Boat</i> (1926), which has a few Negroes singing
the plaintive songs of their “wronged race,” and a
melodramatic scene involving an octoroon.</p>

<p><i>Look Back to Glory</i> (1933) by Herbert Ravenel
Sass is worshipful of the duelling cavaliers and glamorous
women of low-country South Carolina, “a paradise
... the proud, the knightly South.” Slavery is
called a godsend to elevate the Negro from barbarism.
The subtle poison of slavery was the “inevitable” miscegenation,
“invited nine-tenths of the time” by Negro
girls, and guaranteeing “the purity of the southern
women of education and family.” Best characterized
of the Negroes is Vienna, a beautiful quadroon, to
whom “curtsying did not come easy.” The others are
conventional, grateful for the godsend.</p>

<p>The Civil War has long been a favorite subject for
historical novelists, but earlier novels like Winston
Churchill’s <i>The Crisis</i> (1901), Upton Sinclair’s
<i>Manassas</i> (1904) and Mary Johnston’s <i>The Long
Roll</i> (1911) and <i>Cease Firing</i> (1912) are little concerned
with deepening the characterization of the
Negro. <i>The Battleground</i> (1902) by Ellen Glasgow,
has many of the standbys of the plantation tradition—the
noble hero who deplores slavery, the wretched
free Negro and the giant slave who rescues his master
(one of the most familiar battle activities from “Marse
Chan” to <i>So Red The Rose</i>.) Recent Civil War
novels like Caroline Gordon’s <i>None Shall Look Back</i>
(1936) and Clifford Dowdey’s <i>Bugles Blow No More</i>
(1936) are skillfully written and based upon research,
but the latter does not particularly extend to Negro
characters.</p>

<p>The slaves in <i>Old Miss</i> (1929) by T. Bowyer
Campbell are “like children, trusting, expecting, receiving
everything as a matter of course from their masters.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
The hero is proslavery, only because of altruism:
“What would the poor things do without us
to care for them, and see that they pass peaceful,
useful lives?” When Aunt Christian is told that she
is free, she angrily hits her informant with a stick, like
the ancient tyrants upon hearing bad news. Roark
Bradford’s <i>Kingdom Coming</i> (1933) likewise carries
the thesis that freedom was a mistake. Aunt Free
buys her freedom and then does not want it; Telegram
is set free by a Yankee firing squad; free Negroes
die like flies in concentration camps. There is an interesting
account of the “blind Underground” which held
out false hopes of freedom that ended in murder. That
the freed Negro is little better off than the slave is
true in sections that Bradford should know very well,
but it hardly seems a defense of slavery. Promising
“the true story of slavery and the true story of freedom,”
<i>Kingdom Coming</i> merely gives some good local
color of plantation life and voodoo, to support the
century-old beliefs advanced in <i>Swallow Barn</i>.</p>

<p>Stark Young has shown a knowledge of certain types
of Negroes in sketches like “The Poorhouse Goes to
The Circus” (1929) and <i>Heaven Trees</i> (1926). His
best seller, <i>So Red The Rose</i> (1934), is a melancholy
recital of the folk-tales that southerners heard in their
youth. The war blown along by northern and southern
windbags destroys “a gracious system of living that
has seldom seen its equal.” Negroes, in spite of “fetid
... old maid idealism” had their best place in that
system. A typical old faithful, William Veal, seeks his
dead master on the battlefield at night; he felt the
hair of the corpses until he found him: “he knew him
by his hair; you know how fine it was.” In contrast
are the Negro soldiers—grog-filled burners and looters—and
the ingrates who run off to the Yankees and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
stricken with plagues. Written in skillful, disarming
prose, <i>So Red The Rose</i> nevertheless remains a
thrice-told tale.</p>

<p>Elliot Crayton McCants in <i>White Oak Farm</i>
(1928) gives the traditional picture of Reconstruction,
though with less rancor than Page and Dixon. <i>Bottom
Rail On Top</i> (1935) by H. J. Eckenrode is a less
orthodox novel, not in the “bloody-shirt” tradition.
Negroes scatter after emancipation and learn fast in
reconstruction. The hero is often shown siding with
the Negroes and radicals in the brawling.</p>

<p>Not fooled by all of the hallowed creeds of the
South, Margaret Mitchell in the best-selling <i>Gone
With The Wind</i> (1937) accepts whole-heartedly the
traditional estimate of the Negro. “Slaves were
neither miserable nor unfortunate.... There never had
been a slave sold from Tara and only one whipping.”
Mammy, Dilcey, Toby and the other house-servants,
proud of their quality white-folks, disdainful of field
hands, “free issues” and poor whites, have been with
us time and time again. Slaves who were different
were “mean.” The “least energetic, trustworthy and
intelligent and most vicious and brutal” were the ones
who left the plantation to enjoy a long “carnival of
idleness and theft and insolence” interrupted only by
plagues in crowded Atlanta. Negro insults range from
“looking impudent” and being “uppity to a lady” to
assuming Anglo-Saxon prerogatives:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the legislature ... they spent most of their time eating
goobers and easing their unaccustomed feet into and out of new
shoes. They frolicked....</p>
</div>

<p>But the intelligent house-servants, the highest caste,
spoke the correct, heart-warming lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ah done had nuff freedom. Ah wants somebody to feed me
good vittles reglar an’ tell me what ter do an’ what not ter do,
an’ look affer me when Ah gets sick.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>
<p>Needless to say, the Klan is as knightly here as in <i>The
Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan</i>, an authentic
hymn of praise.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i> DuBose Heyward has written: “This
relationship [between master and slave] has been sentimentalized
and utilized <i>ad nauseam</i> in writing of
the slave period.” The plots of the foregoing books
are uninventive, and the characters and situations are
repeated over and over. Aristocrats and house-servants
still monopolize attention, as if the many “yeoman”
farmers and field-hands had not existed. With
the hindsight of the present, secession is admitted to
have been bad, but although most of the aristocrats
detested slavery (in principle), the intelligent Negroes
detested freedom (in principle and practise) and the
romancers agree with the Negroes. The very infrequent
floggings are the work of uncouth overseers,
who are knocked down by blooded cavaliers. Fugitive
slaves have been spirited away from these books.
Faithful servants bring back dead heroes from battlefields,
bury the silver, despise the Yankees and prefer
to work for their ex-masters without wages. Unfaithful
slaves, corrupted from their childish virtue, run
away to die in concentration camps, or loot, insult and
rape. Negroes who bought land, rushed to schools
and proved freedom to be no mistake, are non-existent,
in spite of the record. An unpartisan historian writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These Reconstruction governments erected public school systems;
democratized local and county units, created public social
services, and sought to distribute tax burdens equitably.</p>
</div>

<p>But in these books the legislatures are composed of
a few depraved Northerners, and a mob of Negroes
who did little else but put their feet upon desks and
“eat peanuts by the peck.” The Freedmen’s Bureau
is villainous, the Klan reproachless, organized to preserve
chastity, not for political and economic control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>It is wrong to assume that these books are merely
pageants of a departed past; they definitely further
attitudes that justify the worst kind of contemporary
reaction. Their popularity is a dangerous sign. Based
on the principle that the many must be kept “in their
place” for the good of the few, they encourage slavery
in a world where slaves are still too numerous.</p>

<p><i>The Anti-Slavery Tradition.</i> But there is a party
of opposition which, like Emerson, has cried “fiddle-faddle
to the Old South.” In the tradition of Harriet
Beecher Stowe and Albion Tourgée, some twentieth
century authors have described the tragedy of slavery,
and have dealt with heroes and heroines who would
not buckle under.</p>

<p>Rowland E. Robinson, in <i>Out of Bondage and Other
Stories</i> (collected posthumously in 1936) records the
heroism and drama of the Underground Railroad in
Vermont where slaves on their way to Canada were
hidden in loaded sleighs and wagons, or stowed away
in attics or barnlofts or deserted sugar-houses. John
E. Paynter’s <i>Fugitives of the Pearl</i> (1930) one of
the few historic romances by Negro authors, deals
with the escape of seventy-seven Negroes from Washington
aboard the <i>Pearl</i>, whose captain was an abolitionist.
A Negro informer gave away their plot, and
they were captured down the Potomac. Of the old
school in technique, <i>Fugitives of the Pearl</i> is more fictionalized
history than a re-creation of characters and
settings. But the precarious life of Negroes in antebellum
Washington, “the seat and center of the slave
trade” is truthfully presented.</p>

<p><i>The Railroad to Freedom</i> (1932) by Hildegarde
Swift is the fictionalized biography of Harriet Tubman,
the most famous agent of the Underground Railroad,
and a nurse and scout with the Union troops.
Supposed to be a story for children, <i>The Railroad to</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
<i>Freedom</i> is still one of the best records of an important
movement and a fascinating heroine of American history.
One of America’s finest historical novels, <i>God’s
Angry Man</i> (1933) by Leonard Ehrlich re-creates the
life and times of John Brown. There is unusual sympathy
in the treatment of the Negro characters. These
are Frederick Douglass, who is willing to use violence
against slavers but not against a government arsenal,
realizing bitterly that too many Negroes, broken by
slavery, wanted only “hot yams and a roof and not
to be beaten”; “Emperor” Green, who, in spite of
Douglass’ logic, says the historic “I b’lieve I go wid
de ole man”; Harriet Tubman, the splendid, wanted
“dead or alive, and ten thousand dollars would be
paid for the body”; William Still, who knew more
about the “underground” than any man in the land,
saying to Brown “You free them, I’ll lead them out”;
John Copeland, mulatto student at Oberlin, who left
his garret lamp of learning for an even finer light,
and Dangerfield Newby, killed in action, with a wife
in the far South who was never to be redeemed. All
of these are brought to life in a moving book.</p>

<p><i>Black Thunder</i> (1936) by Arna Bontemps likewise
bears witness to a staunch desire to be free—a fact
of the Negro’s past that most of the historical romancers
have not cared to record. <i>Black Thunder</i> deals
with Gabriel’s Rebellion in the Virginia of 1800.
Gabriel, the strongest slave of Henrico county, is courageous
as well:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I been studying about freedom a heap, me. I heard a plenty
folks talk and I listened a heap.... Something keep telling me
that anything what’s equal to a gray squirrel wants to be free.</p>
</div>

<p>Stimulated by the example of Touissant in Haiti and
by the propaganda of the <i>Amis des Noirs</i> and exasperated
by an act of cruelty, Gabriel leads eleven hundred
slaves upon Richmond. A storm postpones the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
attack, and the treachery of Pharaoh and Ben does
the rest. The leaders are hanged, Gabriel’s sweetheart
Juba is sold to the deep South, and Ben goes on
driving the cariole for the aristocrats. In addition
to Gabriel, other Negroes are excellently characterized:
Ben, the docile, gray-headed house-boy; Melody,
the quadroon darling of rich planters’ sons; Juba,
handsome and spirited, sole woman on the march;
Mingo, whose personal freedom is not enough; and
Bundy, who “kept drinking up all that rum because he
couldn’t get up enough nerve to make his get-away.”
<i>Black Thunder</i> does not have the urgent passion of
<i>God’s Angry Man</i>; it is elegy rather than a tocsin of
revolt, but it is a fine American historical novel.</p>

<p><i>Realism.</i> In <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> Thomas
Wolfe’s autobiographical hero decries</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The romantic halo ... the whole fantastic distortion of that
period where people were said to live in mansions and slavery
was a benevolent institution, conducted to a constant banjo-strumming,
the strewn largesses of the colonel and the shuffle-dance of
his happy dependents, where all women were pure, gentle, beautiful,
all men chivalrous and brave, and the Rebel horde a company
of swagger, death-mocking cavaliers. Years later, when he could
no longer think of the barren spiritual wilderness ... when
their cheap mythology, their legend of the charm of their manners,
the aristocratic culture ... made him writhe ... so great was
his fear of the legend, his fear of their antagonism, that he still
pretended the most fantastic devotion to them.</p>
</div>

<p>Many other southerners of Wolfe’s generation, as
seen in the previous chapter, have recognized the barren
spiritual wilderness; others have repudiated or at
least humanized the legend.</p>

<p>John Peale Bishop, although not so outspoken as
Wolfe and Faulkner, approaches the legend realistically
in <i>Many Thousands Gone</i> (1930), stories of the
Civil War and postwar years. Just as the southerners
are not marvels of gallantry and beauty, the Negroes,
while certainly not flattered, are recognizable products
of slavery. One old woman while her mistress lies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
dead is more worried about her promised freedom
than grief-stricken; a sullen girl blazes forth her hatred
of her carping mistress, and leaves to cook for the
Yankees, for whose love-making she has been prepared
by her experiences with southern gentlemen. In one
symbolic story, Bones, a marvelous cook, gives two
old Virginia ladies a feeling of security; in reality a
lunatic, he is submissive and devoted, and they are
willing to live in terror as long as they can live in the
tradition, their dear “obsession.”</p>

<p>Christopher Ward’s <i>Jonathan Drew, A Rolling
Stone</i> (1932), and <i>A Yankee Rover</i> (1932) carry
the Yankee hero all over early nineteenth century
America. One dramatic section shows Drew saving
two slaves from border ruffians who were running a
“blind underground” and fomenting a slave insurrection
in order to plunder the countryside. <i>A Yankee
Rover</i> deals more fully with slavery; one of the episodes
involves Tommy, the little “white nigger,”
whose aristocratic father does not leave him free.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What d’ye say to a nigger that ain’t no color at all cause he’s
white ... as white as any on ye an’ whiter than most ... with
straight silky hair, no kinks at all, an yaller hair at that,
golden yaller, an’ blue eyes? Ef that ain’t jest a natural curiosity....
Pass up lot 56, Mr. Barnes.</p>
</div>

<p>As we have seen the “blind underground” intrigues
both the realists and the defenders of the Old South,
who traditionally isolate criminals as the agents of the
underground railroad. The “blind underground” did
exist as a profitable enterprise for such gangs as Murrel’s,
but this hardly explains the neglect of the genuine
underground that carried thousands of slaves to
the North. The workings of this system appear incidentally
in MacKinlay Kantor’s <i>Arouse and Beware</i>
(1936). In this impartial and accurate narrative we
have most interesting descriptions of the “Right Sort
of People,” “The Sons of America,” both whites and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Negroes, who with their grips and passwords and
secret hiding places enable three fugitives to get to
the Union lines. One slave woman, in a low tone, gives
them valuable information, and then, to fool her curious
children, curses them. The narrator says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was a canniness about these slaves which I had never
imagined before. I had thought them barbaric or stupid or
lazy ... and doubtless many of them were. And many others,
too, were loyal to their masters and the Confederacy; but somehow
I cannot hear jubilee singers chanting of Moses, and bondage
and their freedom from it, without thinking of this thin, brown-faced
wench, with her high shoulders and long straight arms....</p>
</div>

<p>Andrew Lytle’s “Mister McGregor” (1936) is a
first-rate story of slavery. Rhears, “no common field-hand,
but proud, black and spoiled” had “fretted and
sulled” over McGregor’s whipping his wife Bella, and
rather than run away, he decides to have it out with
his owner. In one of the best fights of “frontier”
realism, Rhears is stabbed by his master. The teller
says of Rhears</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I never seen such guts in nobody, nigger or white man....
Rhears spoke so low you could hardly hear him: “Marster, if you
hadn’t got me, I’d a got you.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Lytle’s <i>The Long Night</i> (1936) Negroes are only
incidental, but the organized stealing of slaves by a
band of frontier criminals is important to the plot.</p>

<p>A young southerner muses disgustedly in Evelyn
Scott’s <i>Migrations</i> (1927): “How close we come to
the niggers without knowing anything about them.”
Being aware that merely “coming close” is not knowledge,
Mrs. Scott presents convincing Negro characters.
Silas is filled with hatred for the white father of his
sweetheart Fanny’s baby. But conditioned to respect
his master, as Fanny had done to her sorrow, he persuades
himself that the overseer was responsible.
His sullen disobedience causes him to be lashed and
he takes to the woods. Bosh is a less successful runaway;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
a half-wit, he frightens a white girl and is
caught by a mob and burned to death. Of a very different
type is Eugenia De Negre Blair, a brilliant and
handsome adventuress, who has a trace of Negro
blood. Without the emphasis of the abolitionists,
Mrs. Scott still records the uneasy and tragic aspects of
slavery.</p>

<p>In <i>The Wave</i> (1929), a series of chronicles of the
Civil War, the stories of Eugenia and Silas are continued.
One of the best sections shows the Negroes
swarming to Sherman’s army; Aunt Nancy, to whom
the army means food but who has given too much
strength to slavery to live to see the promised land
of freedom; Dilsy, who hopes that life-long drudgery
is over; Lou, apologetic because her religious master
had influenced her; Anna, bold and ready; and Uncle
Vic, who has been sold to one “mean piece uv trash
after another.” When the Federals, realizing that
the horde of fugitives is more than they bargained
for, tear up the pontoon bridges, they discover that
the horde still presses on to freedom. “Gawd, you
gotta shoot ’em to stop ’em.” There is symbolism in
both the despairing cry of the Negroes left on the
bank: “My home is ovah Jawdon,” and the callousness
of the Yankee who thinks: “If we could only let them
drown. Dam ’em, they get over their Jordan, but we
have to carry ’em.”</p>

<p>In <i>A Calendar of Sin</i> (1931), Mrs. Scott re-creates
the Reconstruction: the Klan, determined to return
the Negro to slavery—where was the tobacco to come
from?—flogging Negroes, destroying schools, hounding
Yankees; and the carpet-baggers, more intent on
wealth and politics than on helping the impoverished,
ignorant and often shiftless Negroes—both pretending
high idealism to cover up lurking meanness. Good
comedy is in the episode of the old Auntie, who suspicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
of Yankees anyway, leaves the new school in
high dudgeon because, instead of learning to read the
Bible right-off, she is started on the alphabet. There
is a powerful narrative about a mulatto lynched for
assault. Some Negroes, taught by “the raw-hide whip
on their naked backs” betray the Union League and
deny that they want the vote and book-learning.
Others show a grasp of the developing folk-belief that
everything mean and bad in the South “comes to us
fru de Yankees.” Although the narratives are called
“American Melodramas,” Mrs. Scott portrays neither
villains nor heroes but sensitively understood human
beings. And that is why, for truth to an era and a
section, her work is immeasurably superior to such real
melodramas as <i>Gone With the Wind</i>.</p>

<p>T. S. Stribling’s earlier <i>Birthright</i> is excelled by
his trilogy of a southern family: <i>The Forge</i> (1931),
<i>The Store</i> (1933) and <i>Unfinished Cathedral</i> (1934).
In <i>The Forge</i>, the pictures of slave life and character
are among the most convincing in American fiction.
The plantation tradition gets short shrift. Old man
Vaiden runs a one-horse, two-mule farm, but calls
himself a “gentleman” since he owns five Negroes. A
hard-fisted, hard drinking, bull-headed, irascible Primitive
Baptist, blustering in north Alabama dialect
instead of in cultured phrases, he wins some liking
and, more important, is a credible human being. To
Vaiden, as to so many farmers “on the make,” slavery
meant “working the daylight out of slaves.” The
slaves’ food is little more than corn-dodgers and bacon,
and the boasted medical care is what “would be given
a sick calf.” Attached to the family and farm by
lifelong ties, the slaves still want freedom. While
George is being praised as devoted, he is nursing hatred
against his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Gracie Vaiden stands out. Although friendly with
her white half-sisters, she broods over slavery. She
feels that the flogging of her husband</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>transformed her from a kind of tentative wife of Solomon into a
brood mare ... changed Solomon into a stud; and her child, if
she and Solomon had a child, into a little animal.</p>
</div>

<p>She reasons correctly; she is ravished by Miltiades
Vaiden who does not know that he is her half-brother.
On the eve of secession she would have been sold to
clear up her father’s debts if she had not escaped to
the Yankee lines. Stribling’s pictures of the Reconstruction,
especially of the Klan, are likewise unorthodox
and authentic.</p>

<p>In <i>The Store</i> Gracie Vaiden, who has been the mistress
first of the Yankee lieutenant who becomes governor
of Alabama, and then of a white merchant, a
pillar of the church, works so that her octoroon son
can escape the shame she has met with as a Negro.
From the start, however, we see that Touissaint
is doomed. “The most despisable nigger in Florence,”
he will not run from bullying white boys, hates shining
shoes, and insists upon honest dealing in the store,
standing up for a whole pound when “everybody knows
a nigger pound is about twelve ounces.” Come of age,
he tries to vote, but his blue eyes and blond hair do not
prove that his grandfather was free; and he fights a
“cracker” who insults his mother. Just as his mother
was put on the block because her white half-sisters and
brothers ran up bills at the store, so Touissaint loses
all of his year’s work because his landlord (and father)
messes up a business deal. As an end to his rebellious
career he is lynched. While Gracie is cutting down
his body, “A dozen drunken voices in the mob broke
into laughter at the downfall of the Negro mother
and her dead son.” His father furnishes the mules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and wagon to carry him away. Other Negro characters
are surly, cunning and aware of what is being
done to them: “If dey shawt weight you too much,
wras’le wid de Lawd about hit in prayah”.... “If a
white man di’n fly into uh niggah tull he done somepin
to him, all us niggahs be settin’ in easy chairs.” Stribling
presents with fine sympathy the Negro urchin who
announced the miracle: “I can write my name....”
Lucy, Touissaint’s wife, prefers farming to domestic
service. She thereby astounds the ex-planters to
whom these “uppish” Negroes who want independence
and education are “unnatural, highly affected and
utterly absurd ... the new uncomfortable colored
people.”</p>

<p>In <i>Unfinished Cathedral</i> the Negro characters are
shown to be more and more progressive and educated,
but still subjected to indecency from both upper-class
and hoodlum whites. Militant Negroes are now in
the picture; even beneath their grotesque robes, the
lodge brothers carry guns. There is a frame-up very
similar to the Scottsboro case; the bankers, realtors,
sheriffs, judges, and even clergy are shown to be closely
related to lynching mobs. One of the boys hustled
off a train is Gracie’s great-grandson. To Miltiades
Vaiden, now eminently respectable, Gracie cries out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What colored relations? I was born to my mother, old Hannah,
long after Old Pap sold off her husband Jericho! I’m not white
for nothing! Aunt Creasy told me long ago that my father was
Old Pap, the same as yours! Toussaint, the son I had by you,
was nothing but a Vaiden on both sides. The child Lucy had by
Toussaint, the son you hanged, I named Marcia; and Marcia’s
boy you’re holding in jail this minute. Who would my grandchild
come back to see except white people, Miltiades?</p>
</div>

<p>To these words the old Colonel replies: “Shame on
you, Gracie ... talking disrespectfully like this.” In
spite of some faults, such as the stretched coincidences,
this trilogy is remarkable for the honesty, courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
and sympathy with which a southern author has
faced the past.</p>

<p>William Faulkner’s “The Raid” (1934) describes
the blowing up of the bridges to destroy the Negroes
following Sherman’s army, a scene relished by southerners
as symbolic, but the slave boy Ringo and the
doggedly marching contrabands are excellently done.
Thoroughly conversant with the old South, Faulkner
has created in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> (1936) a credible
and powerful, if at times fantastic novel out of “a few
old mouth-to-mouth tales” and old letters. From the
bleak hills of western Virginia where the cabins were
“boiling with children,” Thomas Sutpen comes to frontier
Mississippi, “a country of lawless opportunity.”
Naked, plastered over with muck against mosquitoes,
he and his “wild Negroes tore a plantation out of the
wilderness ... dragged a house and garden out of the
virgin swamp.” But the Sutpen line is doomed.
Charles Bon, Sutpen’s son by a woman in Haiti, who
was discarded because she had a “spot of Negro
blood,” is murdered to keep him from marrying Sutpen’s
daughter (the incest was less abhorred than the
miscegenation). The Sutpen fortunes decline, until at
the last we see Jim Bond, Charles Bon’s mulatto
grandson, lurking around the ashes of the destroyed
mansion. A Mississippi “Fall of the House of
Usher,” <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> seems in part an allegory
of slavery. Negro characters, whether the savages so
like their wild master, or Clytie, Sutpen’s mulatto
daughter, who could be neither tamed nor freed, or
Charles Bon, most elegant cavalier and yet of Negro
blood; or Charles’ son, who in self-laceration turns
completely to Negroes, are original and convincing,
“living creatures, living flesh to feel pain and writhe
and cry out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i> A northerner in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>
ironical at the tyranny of the southern legends, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What is it? Something you live and breathe in like air?...
A kind of entailed birthright ... of never forgiving General
Sherman, so that forevermore as long as your children’s children
produce children you won’t be anything but a descendant of a
long line of colonels killed in Pickett’s charge at Manassas?</p>
</div>

<p>Faulkner himself has felt the fascination of the plantation
birthright, but he determined to be honest in
spite of tradition. Of a different order of genius, he
still belongs with his fellow southerners Stribling and
Evelyn Scott, who are trying above all else to give a
truthful reinterpretation of the old South, and therefore
of the Negro. Their work is by no means completely
adequate, but together with the work of other
honest, sympathetic writers, northern and southern,
Negro and white, historical novelists or recorders of
contemporary America, it gives promise that the Negro
character in fiction may meet with the justice that has
been so long deferred.</p>


<p class="c p2">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</p>

<p>1. Since slavery has been abolished, what social
policy is served by the continued defense of the plantation
tradition?</p>

<p>2. List similar characters and incidents in the plantation
tradition novels of this chapter.</p>

<p>3. Describe the antislavery heroes mentioned as the
plantation tradition would characterize them.</p>

<p>4. Why are so many southern aristocrats in these
books shown as opponents of slavery?</p>

<p>5. Account for the best-selling qualities of <i>So Red
the Rose</i> and <i>Gone With The Wind</i>.</p>

<p>6. Defend, attack, or qualify: “Since these historical
romances are based on research, they must be
truthful about Negro life and character.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>7. What are the contributions of Stribling and
Evelyn Scott to the southern historical novel?</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
